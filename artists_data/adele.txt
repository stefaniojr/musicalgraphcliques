IndonesiaHello
Lyrics
Hello,
it's
me
I
was
wondering
if
after
all
these
years
you'd
like
to
meet
To
go
over
everything
They
say
that
time's
supposed
to
heal
ya,
but
I
ain't
done
much
healing
Hello,
can
you
hear
me?
I'm
in
California
dreaming
about
who
we
used
to
be
When
we
were
younger
and
free
I've
forgotten
how
it
felt
before
the
world
fell
at
our
feet
There's
such
a
difference
between
us
And
a
million
miles
Hello
from
the
other
side
I
must've
called
a
thousand
times
To
tell
you
I'm
sorry
for
everything
that
I've
done
But
when
I
call,
you
never
seem
to
be
home
Hello
from
the
outside
At
least,
I
can
say
that
I've
tried
To
tell
you
I'm
sorry
for
breaking
your
heart
But
it
don't
matter,
it
clearly
doesn't
tear
you
apart
anymore
Hello,
how
are
you?
It's
so
typical
of
me
to
talk
about
myself,
I'm
sorry
I
hope
that
you're
well
Did
you
ever
make
it
out
of
that
town
where
nothing
ever
happened?
You
might
also
like
It's
no
secret
that
the
both
of
us
Are
running
out
of
time
So
hello
from
the
other
side
(Other
side)
I
must've
called
a
thousand
times
(Thousand
times)
To
tell
you
I'm

done
But
when
I

you
never

Ooh,

Hello

On
Me
Lyrics
There
ain't
no
gold
in
this
river
That
I've
been
washin'
my
hands
in
forever
I
know
there
is
hope
in
these
waters
But
I
can't
bring
myself
to
swim
When
I
am
drowning
in
this
silence
Baby,
let
me
in
Go
easy
on
me,
baby
I
was
still
a
child
Didn't
get
the
chance
to
Feel
the
world
around
me
I
had
no
time
to
choose
what
I
chose
to
do
So
go
easy
on
me
There
ain't
no
room
for
things
to
change
When
we
are
both
so
deeply
stuck
in
our
ways
You
can't
deny
how
hard
I've
tried
I
changed
who
I
was
to
put
you
both
first
But
now
I
give
up
Go
easy
on
mе,
baby
I
was
still
a
child
Didn't
get
the
chance
to
Feel
thе
world
around
me
Had
no
time
to
choose
what
I
chose
to
do
So
go
easy
on
me
You
might
also
like
I
had
good
intentions
And
the
highest
hopes
But
I
know
right
now
It
probably
doesn't
even
show
Go
easy
on
me,
baby
I
was
still
a
child
I
didn't
get
the
chance
to
Feel
the
world
around
me
I
had
no
time
to
choose
what
I
chose
to
do
So
go
easy
on
me156Embed

You
Lyrics
I
heard
that
you're
settled
down
That
you
found
a
girl
and
you're
married
now
I
heard
that
your
dreams
came
true
Guess
she
gave
you
things
I
didn't

to
you
Old
friend,
why
are
you
so
shy?
Ain't
like
you
to
hold
back
or
hide
from
the
light
I
hate
to
turn
up
out
of
the
blue,
uninvited
But
I
couldn't
stay
away,
I
couldn't
fight
it
I
had
hoped
you'd
see
my
face
And
that
you'd
be
reminded
that
for
me,
it
isn't
over
Never
mind,
I'll
find
someone
like
you
I
wish
nothing
but
the
best
for
you,
too
Don't
forget
me,
I
beg
I
remember
you
said
Sometimes
it
lasts
in
love,
but
sometimes
it
hurts
instead
Sometimes
it

in
love,
but
sometimes

You
know
how
the
time
flies
Only
yesterday
was
the
time
of
our
lives
We
were
born
and
raised
in
a
summer
haze
Bound
by
the
surprise
of
our
glory
days

There's
a
fire
starting
in
my

Reaching
a

pitch
and
it's
bringing
me
out
the
dark
Finally,
I
can
see
you
crystal

Go
ahead
and
sell
me
out
and
I'll
lay
your
shit
bare
See
how
I'll
leave
with

piece
of
you
Don't
underestimate
the
things
that
I
will
do
There's
a
fire
starting
in
my
heart
Reaching
a
fever
pitch,
and
it's
bringing
me
out
the
dark
The
scars
of
your
love
remind
me
of
us
They
keep
me
thinkin'
that
we
almost
had
it
all
The
scars
of
your
love,
they
leave
me
breathless
I
can't
help
feeling
We
could've
had
it
all
(You're
gonna
wish
you
never
had
met
me)
Rolling
in
the

(Tears

rolling
in

deep)
You
had
my
heart
inside
of
your
hand
(You're
gonna
wish
you
never
had
met
me)
And
you
played
it
to
the
beat
(Tears
are
gonna
fall,
rolling
in
the
deep)
Baby,
I
have
no
story
to
be
told
But
I've
heard
one
on
you,
now
I'm
gonna
make
your
head
burn
Think
of
me
in
the
depths
of
your
despair
Make
a
home
down
there,
as
mine
sure
won't
be
shared
You

Everybody

From

Everybody
here
is
watching
you
'Cause
you

you're

But
if

Can
I

'Cause
I've
been
by
myself
all
night
long
Hoping
you're
someone

You

Fire
to
the
Rain
Lyrics
I
let
it
fall,
my
heart
And
as
it
fell,
you
rose
to
claim
it
It
was
dark,
and
I
was
over
Until
you
kissed
my
lips
and
you
saved
me
My
hands,
they
were
strong
But
my
knees
were
far
too
weak
To
stand
in
your
arms
Without
falling
to
your
feet
But
there's
a
side
to
you
That
I
never
knew,
never

All
the
things
you'd
say
They
were
never
true,
never
true
And
the
games
you'd
play
You
would
always
win,
always
win
But
I
set
fire
to
the
rain
Watched
it
pour
as
I
touched
your
face
Well,
it
burned
while
I
cried
'Cause
I
heard
it
screamin'
out
your

Your

You
might
also

When
I
lay
with
you
I
could
stay
there,
close
my

Feel

You
and
me
together,
nothing
is
better
'Cause
there's
a
side
to
you
That
I
never

All
the

They
were
never

And

To
Be
Loved
(Srpski
Prevod)To
Be
Loved
Lyrics
I
built
a
house
for
a
love
to
grow
I
was
so
young
that
it
was
hard
to
know
I'm
as
lost
now
as
I
was
back
then
Always
make
a
mess
of
everything
It's
about
time
that
I
face
myself
All
I
do
is
bleed
into
someone
else
Painting
walls
with
all
my
secret
tears
Filling
rooms
with
all
my
hopes
and
fears
But,
oh,
my
Oh,
my
I'll
never
learn
if
I
never
leap
I'll
always
yearn
if
I
never
speak
To
be
loved
and
love
at
the
highest
count
Means
to
lose
all
the
things
I
can't
live
without
Let
it
be
known
that
I
will
choose
to
lose
It's
a
sacrifice,
but
I
can't
live
a
lie
Let
it
be
known,
let
it
be
known
that
I
tried
I'm
so
afraid,
but
I'm
open
wide
I'll
be
the
one
to
catch
myself
this
time
Tryna
learn
to
lean
into
it
all
Ain't
it
funny
how
the
mighty
fall?
Looking
back,
I
don't
regret
a
thing
Yeah,
I
took
some
bad
turns
that
I
am
owning
I'll
stand
still
and
let
the
storm
pass
by
Keep
my
heart
safe
till
the
time
feels
right
You
might
also
like
But,
oh,
my
Oh,
my
I'll
never
learn
if
I
never

I'll
always

can't

Let
it
be
known
Let
it
be
known
that
I
cried
for
you
Even
started
lying
to
you
What
a
thing
to
do
All
because
I
wanted
To
be
loved
and
love
at
the
highest
count
Means
to
lose
all
the
things
I
can't
live
without
Let
it

That
I
will
choose,
I
will
lose
It's
a

When

And

I

When

And

But
I
will
never

you
wrong
I've
known
it
from
the
moment
that
we
met
No
doubt
in
my
mind
where
you
belong
I'd
go
hungry,
I'd
go
black
and
blue
I'd
go
crawling

You

Don't

(Srpski
Prevod)PortuguêsDeutschفارسیPolskiFrançaisI
Drink
Wine
Lyrics
How
can
one
become
so
bounded
by
choices
that
somebody
else
makes?
How
come
we've
both
become
a
version
of
a
person
we
don't
even
like?
We're
in
love
with
the
world,
but
the
world
just
wants
to
bring
us
down
By
puttin'
ideas
in
our
heads
that
corrupt
our
hearts
somehow
When
I
was
a
child,
every
single
thing
could
blow
my
mind
Soaking
it
all
up
for
fun,
but
now
I
only
soak
up
wine
They
say
to
play
hard,
you
work
hard,
find
balance
in
the
sacrifice
And
yet
I
don't
know
anybody
who's
truly
satisfied
You
better
believe
I'm
tryin'
(Tryin',
tryin')
To
keep
climbin'
(Climbin',
climbin')
But
the
higher
we
climb
feels
like
we're
both
none
the
wiser
So
I
hope
I
learn
to
get
over
myself
Stop
tryin'
to
be
somebody
else
So
we
can
love
each
other
for
free
Everybody
wants
somethin',
you
just
want
me
Why
am
I
obsessin'
about
the
things
I
can't
control?
Why
am
I
seekin'
approval
from
people
I
don't
even
know?
In
these
crazy
times,
I
hope
to
find
somethin'
I
can
cling
on
to
'Cause
I
need
some
substance
in
my
life,
somethin'
real,
somethin'
that
feels
true
You
might
also
like
You
better
believe
for
you,
I've
cried
(I've
cried,
I've
cried)
High
tides
(High
tides,
high
tides)
'Cause
I
want
you
so
bad,
but
you
can't
fight
fire
with
fire,
oh
So
I
hope
I
learn
to
get
over
myself
Stop
tryin'
to
be
somebody
else
Oh,
I
just
want
to
love
you,
love
you
for
free
Everybody
wants
somethin'
from
me,
you
just
want
me
Listen,
I
know
how
low
I
can
go,
I
give
as
good
as
I
get
You
get
the
brunt
of
it
all
'cause
you're
all
I've
got
left
Oh,
I
hope
in
time
(Hope
in
time)
We
both
will
find
peace
of
mind
(We
both
find)
Sometimes,
the
road
less
travelled
is
a
road
best
left
behind
Well,
I
hope
I
learn
to
get
over
myself
Stop
tryin'
to
be
somebody
else
Oh,
I
just
want
to
love
you,
love
you
for
free,
yeah
'Cause
everybody
wants
somethin'
from
me,
you
just
want
me
You
better
believe
I'm
tryin'
(Tryin',
tryin')
To
keep
climbin'
(Climbin',
climbin')
But
the
higher
we
climb,
feels
like
we're
both
none
the
wiser
The
only
regret
I
have
I
wish
that
it
was
just
at
a
different
time
A
most
turbulent
period
of
my
life
Why
would
I
put
that
on
you?
That's
just,
like,
a
very
heavy
thing
to
have
to
talk
about
But
because
of
that
period
of
time
Even
though
it
was
so
much
fun
I
didn't
get
to
go
on
and
make
new
memories
with
him
There
was
just
memories
in
a
big
storm16Embed

Little
Love
Lyrics
My
little
love
I
see
your
eyes
widen
like
an
ocean
When
you
look
at
me
so
full
of
my
emotions
I'm
findin'
it
hard
to
be
here
sincerely
I
know
you
feel
lost,
it's
my
fault
completely
Tell
me
you
love
me
I
love
you
a
million
percent
I
don't
recognise
myself
in
the
coldness
of
the
daylight
So
I
ain't
surprised
you
can
read
through
all
of
my
lies
I
feel
so
bad
to
be
here
when
I'm
so
guilty
I'm
so
far
gone
and
you're
the
only
one
who
can
save
mе
Oi,
I
feel
like
you
don't
love
me
Why
do
you
feel
likе
that?
Do
you
like
me?
You
know
mummy
doesn't
like
anyone
else
like
I
like
you,
right?
I'm
holdin'
on
(Barely)
Mama's
got
a
lot
to
learn
(It's
heavy)
I'm
holdin'
on
(Catch
me)
Mama's
got
a
lot
to
learn
(Teach
me)
You

Mummy's
been
having
a
lot
of
big
feelings
recently
Like
how?
Just,
like,
hang
on,
my
fingers
are
trapped
Like,
um,
I
feel
a
bit
confused
Why?
I
don't
know
And
I
feel
like
I
don't
really
know
what
I'm
doing
Oh,
at
all?
At
all
And
that
would
make
me
go...
My
little
love
Tell
me,
do
you
feel
the
way
my
past
aches?
When
you
lay
on
me,
can
you
hear
the
way
my
heart
breaks?
I
wanted
you
to
have
everything
I
never
had
I'm
so
sorry
if
what
I've
done
makes
you
feel
sad
I
love
your
dad
'cause
he
gave
you
to
me
You're
half
me
and
you're
half
daddy
Oh
I'm
holdin'
on
(Barely)
Mama's
got
a
lot
to
learn
(It's
heavy)
I'm
holdin'
on
(Catch
me)
Mama's
got
a
lot
to
learn
(Teach

I'm
having
a
bad
day,
I'm
having
a
very
anxious
day
I
feel
very
paranoid,
I
feel
very
stressed
Um,
I
have
a
hangover,
which
never
helps,
but
I
feel
like
today
is
the
first
day
since
I
left
him
that
I
feel
lonely
And
I
never
feel
lonely,
I
love
being
on
my
own
I
always
preferred
being
on
my
own
than
being
with
people
And
I
feel
like
maybe
I've
been,
like,
overcompensating
And
being
out
and
stuff
like
that
to
keep
my
mind
off
of
him
And
I
feel
like
today,
I'm
home
and
I
wanna
be
at
home
I
just
wanna
watch
TV
and
curl
up
in
a
ball
and
Be
in
my
sweats
and
stuff
like
that,
but
I
just
feel
really
lonely
I
feel
a
bit
frightened
that
I
might
feel
like
this

in
the
Dark
Lyrics
Take
your
eyes
off
of
me
so
I
can
leave
I'm
far
too
ashamed
to
do
it
with
you
watching
me
This
is
never
ending,
we
have
been
here
before
But
I
can't
stay
this
time
'cause
I
don't
love
you
anymore
Please
stay
where
you
are,
don't
come
any
closer
Don't
try
to
change
my
mind,
I'm
being
cruel
to
be
kind
I
can't
love
you
in
the
dark
It
feels
like
we're
oceans
apart
There
is
so
much
space
between
us
Baby,
we're
already
defeated
Ah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah,
everything
changed
me
You
have
given
me
something
that
I
can't
live
without
You
mustn't
underestimate
that
when
you
are
in
doubt
But
I
don't
want
to
carry
on
like
everything
is
fine
The
longer
we
ignore
it
all,
the
more
that
we
will
fight
Please
don't
fall
apart,
I
can't
face
your
breaking
heart
I'm
trying
to
be
brave,
stop
asking
me
to
stay
You
might
also
like
I
can't

Baby,

Ah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah,
everything
changed
me
We're
not
the
only
ones
I
don't
regret
a
thing
Every
word
I've
said
You
know
I'll
always
mean
It
is
the
world
to
me
That
you
are
in
my
life
But
I
want
to
live
and
not
just
survive
That's
why
I
can't
love
you
in
the
dark
It
feels
like
we're
oceans
apart
There
is
so

And

Lyrics
Hold

You
are
still
strong
Love
will
soon
come
Just
hold,
hold
on
Oh,
what
have
I
done
yet
again?
Have
I
not
learned
anything?
I
don't
want
to
live
in
chaos
It's
like
a
ride
that
I
want
to
get
off
It's
hard
to
hold
on
to
who
I
am
When
I'm
stumblin'
in
the
dark
for
a
hand
I
am
so
tired
of
battling
with
myself,
with
no
chance
to
win
(Hold
on)
Let
time
be
patient
(You
are
still
strong)
Let
pain
be
gracious
(Love
will
soon
come)
Just
hold,
hold
on
I
swear
to
God,
I
am
such
a
mess
The
harder
that
I
try,
I
regress
I'm
my
own
worst
enemy
Right
now,
I
truly
hate
bein'
me
Every
day
feels
like
the
road
I'm
on
Might
just
open
up
and
swallow
me
whole
How
do
I
feel
so
mighty
small
When
I'm
struggling
to
feel
at
all?
You
might

(You,

you,

Hold

(You,
just
hold

Sometimes,
loneliness
is
the
only
rest
we
get
(Just
hold
on,
just
hold
on)
And
the
emptiness
actually
lets
us
forget
(Just
hold
on,
just
hold
on)
Sometimes,
forgiveness
is
easiest
in
secret
(Just
hold
on,
just
hold
on,
just
hold
on,
just
hold
on)
So
just
hold
on,
ooh
Let
time
be
patient
and
(You
are
still
strong)
Let
pain
be
gracious
Love
will
soon
come,
baby
If
you
just
hold
on
Hold
on,
hold
on,
hold
on,
hold
on
(Hold
on)
Just
let
time
be
patient
'Cause
you're
still
strong,
you're
still
strong
(You
are
still

Just
be
gracious
Love
will
soon
come
If
you

(You,
just

you,

I
only
wanted
to
have
fun
Learning
to
fly,
learning
to
run
I
let
my
heart
decide
the
way
When
I
was
young
Deep
down,
I
must
have
always
known
That
this
would
be
inevitable
To
earn
my
stripes,
I'd
have
to
pay
And
bare
my
soul
I
know
I'm
not
the
only
one
Who
regrets
the
things
they've
done
Sometimes,
I
just
feel
it's
only
me
Who
can't
stand
the
reflection
that
they
see
I
wish
I
could
live
a
little
more
Look
up
to
the

not
just
the

I
feel
like
my

And
all
I
can

is

I

I

Where
I

found
my
feet
They
can't
look
me
in
the
eye
It's
like
they're
scared
of
me
I
try
to
think
of
things
to
say
Like
a
joke
or
a
memory
But
they
don't
recognize
me
now
In
the
light
of
day
I
know
I'm
not
the

Who
regrets
the

For

Every

I'll
pay
respects
and
say
I'm
sorry
For
they
never
stood
a
chance
as

could
When

I've
never

All

Surely,
you
know

I'm
not
easy
to
hold
It's
so
sad
how
incapable
of
learning
to
grow
I
am
My
heart
speaks
in
puzzle
and
codes
I've
been
trying
my
whole
life
to
solve
God
only
knows
how
I've
cried
I
can't
take
another
defeat
A
next
time
would
be
the
ending
of
me
Now
that
I
see
That
love
is
a
game
for
fools
to
play
And
I
ain't

what
a

And
I

(Fooling),
what

To
self-inflict

How
unbelievable
(Unbelievable)
Of
me
to
fall
for
the
lies
that
I
tell
(Lies

The
dream
that
I
sell
(Dream

When
heartache,
it's
inevitable
(And
unbearable)
But
I'm
no
good
at
doing
it
well
Not
that
I
care
(I
don't
care)
Why
should
anything
about
it
be
fair?

Lyrics
I
remember
all
of
the
things
that
I
thought
I
wanted
to
be
So
desperate
to
find
a
way
out
of
my
world
and
finally
breathe
Right
before
my
eyes
I
saw
my
heart,
it
came
to
life
This
ain't
easy,
it's
not
meant
to
be,
every
story
has
its
scars
But
when
the
pain
cuts
you
deep
When
the
night
keeps
you
from
sleeping
Just
look
and
you
will
see
that
I
will
be
your
remedy
When
the
world
seems
so
cruel
And
your
heart
makes
you
feel
like
a
fool
I
promise
you
will
see
that
I
will
be
I
will
be
your
remedy
No
river
is
too
wide
or
too
deep
for
me
to
swim
to
you
Come
whatever,
I'll
be
the
shelter
that
won't
let
the
rain
come
through
Your
love,
it
is
my
truth
and
I
will
always
love
you
Love
you,
oh
When
the

cuts
you
deep
When

Lyrics
You're
driving
me
away,
give
me
a
reason
to
stay
I
want
to
be
lost
in
you,
but
not
in
this
way
Don’t
think
you
quite
understand
who
you
have
on
your
hands
How
can
you
not
see
just
how
good
for
you
I
am?
I
know
that
you've
been
hurt
before
That's
why
you
feel
so
insecure
I
begged
you
to
let
me
in
’cause
I
only
want
to
be
the
cure
If
you
don't
choose
to
grow,
we
ain't
ever
gonna
know
Just
how
good
this
could
be
I
really
hoped
that
this
would
go
somewhere
Complacency
is
the
worst
trait
to
have,
are
you
crazy?
You
ain't
never
had,
ain't
never
had
a
woman
like
me
It
is
so
sad
a
man
likе
you
could
be
so
lazy
Consistency
is
the
gift
to
givе
for
free
and
it
is
key
To
ever
keep,
to
ever
keep
a
woman
like
me
All
you
do
is
complain
about
decisions
you
make
How
can
I
help
lift
you
if
you
refuse
to
activate
the
life
that
you
truly
want?
I
know
it's
hard,
but
it's
not
We
come
from
the
same
place,
but
you
will
never
give
it
up
It's
where
they
make
you
feel
powerful
That’s
why
you
think
I
make
you
feel
small
But
that’s
your
projection,
it's
not
my
rejection
I
put
my
heart
on
the
line
for
the
very
first
time
Because
you
asked
me
to
and
now
you’ve
gone
and
changed
your
mind
But
lovin'
you
was
a
breakthrough
I
saw
what
my
heart
can
really
do
Now
some
other
man
will
get
the
love
I
had
for
you

Lyrics
When
will
I
see
you
again?
You
left
with
no
goodbye,
not
a
single
word
was
said
No
final
kiss
to
seal
any
sins
I
had
no
idea
of
the
state
we
were
in
I
know
I
have
a
fickle
heart
and
a
bitterness
And
a
wandering
eye,
and
a
heaviness
in
my
head
But
don't
you
remember?
Don't
you
remember?
The
reason
you
loved
me
before
Baby,
please
remember
me
once
more
When
was
the
last
time
that
you
thought
of
me?
Or
have
you
completely
erased
me
from
your
memory?
I
often
think
about
where
I
went
wrong
The
more
I
do,
the
less
I
know
But
I
know
I
have
a
fickle
heart
and
a
bitterness
And
a
wandering
eye,
and
a
heaviness
in
my
head
You

Don't

The
reason

loved

before
Baby,
please
remember
me
once

Gave
you
the
space
so
you
could
breathe
I
kept
my
distance
so
you
would
be
free
In
hope
that
you'd
find
the
missing
piece
To
bring
you
back
to
me
Why
don't
you
remember?
Don't

Baby,

Interlude
Lyrics
I
know
you've
got
things
to
do
(I
do,
too)
I
just
wanna
spend
all
my
time
with
you
(It
feels
so
good)
I'm
so
hard
to
impress,
don't
leave
me
on
this
stretch
alone
When
I'm
out
at
a
party,
I'm
just
excited
to
get
home
And
dream
about
you
All
night
long
I
don't
know
how
you
got
through
to
me
(I'm
so
cold)
It's
all
happenin'
so
easily
(Like,
oh,
my
God)
It's
so
hard
to
digest,
usually,
I'm
best
alone
But
every
time
that
you
text,
I
want
to
get
on
the
next
flight
home
And
dream
next
to
you
All
night
long
Maybe
it's
the
way
you
remind
me
of
(Where
I
come
from)
Or
how
you
make
me
feel
beautiful
(And
thеn
some)
The
sight
of
you
is
dramatic,
one
glimpsе
and
I
panic
inside
I
get
lost
in
our
hours
'cause
you
possess
powers
I
can't
fight

Lyrics
Everybody
tells
me
it's
'bout
time
that
I
moved
on
That
I
need
to
learn
to
lighten
up
and
learn
how
to
be
young
But
my
heart
is
a
valley,
it's
so
shallow
and
manmade
I'm
scared
to
death
if
I
let
you
in
that
you'll
see
I'm
just
a
fake
Sometimes
I
feel
lonely
in
the
arms
of
your
touch
But
I
know
that's
just
me
'cause
nothing
ever
is
enough
When
I
was
a
child
I
grew
up
by
the
River
Lea
There
was
something
in
the
water,
now
that
something's
in
me
Oh,
I
can't
go
back,
but
the
reeds
are
growing
out
of
my
fingertips
I
can't
go
back
to
the
river
But,
it's
in
my
roots,
in
my

In

and
I
stain

I
use
to

Oh,

in

In

So,
I

Lea,

Yeah,
I

River
Lea,

Lea,

I
should
probably
tell
you
now
before
it's
way
too
late
That
I
never
meant
to
hurt
you
or
lie
straight
to
your
face
Consider
this
my
apology,
I

it's

But,

say
it

I

With

there
ain't

that
I
can't
adore
The
way
I'm
running
with
you,

Means
we
can
break

it
funny
that
you're

I
never

There
is
something
in

tears
down

I
wasn't

The

Hit
me
like

All

I've
been
frozen
The
sweetest

I
know
I'll
forever
be
whatever
you
want
me
to
be
I'll
go

all
over
for
your

When
you
wonder

Just

In

And
there
is
something
'bout

you
love
me
That
finally
feels

You're
my

you're

You're

You're

you're

You're

I

I

Daydreamer
Sitting
on
the
sea
Soaking
up
the
sun
He
is
a
real
lover
Of
making
up
the
past
And
feeling
up
his
girl
Like
he's
never
felt
her
figure
before
A
jaw
dropper
Looks
good
when
he
walks
Is
the
subject
of
their
talk
He
would
be
hard
to
chase
But
good
to
catch
And
he
could
change
the
world
With
his
hands
behind
his
back,
oh
You
can
find
him
sitting
on
your
doorstep
Waiting
for
a
surprise
And
he
will
feel
like
he's
been
there
for
hours
And
you
can
tell
that
he'll
be
there
for
life
Daydreamer
With
eyes
that
make
you
melt
He
lends
his
coat
for
shelter
Plus
he's
there
for
you
When
he
shouldn't
be
But
he
stays
all
the
same
Waits

Then
sees
you

Let
Go
Lyrics
When
did
it
go
wrong?
I
will
never
know
I
have
loved
you
all
my
life
How
did
it
slow
down?
I
go
round
and
around
Thinking
about
it
all
the
time
I
gave
you
heaven
on
a
platter,
baby
I
gave
you
everything
you
never
gave
me
I
never
lied
and
I
never
faked
it
Only
wanted
for
you
to
save
me
This
love,
it
ain't
over
yet
There's
too
much
that
I
haven't
said
Did
you
find
the
note
that
I
wrote?
I
hid
it
in
the
seam
of
your
coat
It
was
hard
to
write
with
a
lump
in
my
throat
Do
you
even
know
that
I
can't
let
go?
Why
were
you
so
cold?
Let
the
truth
be
told
Tell
me,
was
it
all
for
the
thrill?
What
was
I
thinking?
I
gave
you
everything
But
you
still
went
for
the
kill
You
might
also
like
I
gave
you
heaven
on
a
platter,
baby
I
gave
you
everything
you
never
gave
me
I
never
lied
and
I
never
faked
it
Only

Ooh,
sometimes
I
feel
like
I'm
in
the
dark
Ooh,
I
thought
I'd
die
in
your

Did

find

My
Heart
to
Stone
Lyrics
Right
under
my
feet
is
air
made
of
bricks
That
pulls
me
down
and
turns
me
weak
for
you
I
find
myself
repeating
like
a
broken
tune
And
I'm
forever
excusing
your
intentions
Then,
I
give
in
to
my
pretendings
Which
forgive
you
each
time
Without
me
knowing
They
melt
my
heart
to
stone
And
I
hear
your
words
that
I
made
up
You
say
my
name
like
there
could
be
an
us
I
best
tidy
up
my
head,
I'm
the
only
one
in
love
I'm
the
only
one
in
love
Each
and
every
time
I
turn
around
to
leave
I
feel
my
heart
begin
to
burst
and
bleed
So,
desperately,
I
try
to
link
it
with
my
head
But
instead,
I
fall
back
to
my
knees
As
you
tear
your
way
right
through
me
I
forgive
you
once
again
Without
me
knowing
You've
burnt
my
heart
to
stone
You
might
also

And
I
hear
your
words
that
I
made
up
You
say
my
name

there
could
be

I
best
tidy

I'm
the

I'm
the
only
one

Why
do
you
steal
my
hand
Whenever
I'm
standing
my

ground?
You
build
me
up
and
leave
me
there
Well,
I

Lyrics
Found
myself
today
singin'
out
loud
your
name
You
said
I'm
crazy,
if
I
am,
I'm
crazy
for
you
Sometimes
sittin'
in
the
dark,
wishin'
you
were
here
Turns
me
crazy,
but
it's
you
who
makes
me
lose
my
head
And
every
time
I'm
meant
to
be
acting
sensible
You
drift
into
my
head
and
Turn
me
into
a
crumblin'
fool
Tell
me
to
run
and
I'll
race
If
you
want
me
to
stop
I'll
freeze
And
if
you
want
me
gone,
I'll
leave
Just
hold
me
closer,
baby
And
make
me
crazy
for
you
Crazy
for
you
Lately
with
this
state
I'm
in,
I
can't
help
myself
but
spin
I
wish
you'd
come
over,
send
me
spinning
closer
to
you
My,
oh
my,
how
my
blood
boils,
it's
sweet
taste
for
you
Strips
me
down
bare
and
gets
me
into
my
favourite
mood
I
keep
on
trying,
fighting
these
feelings
away
But
the
more
I
do
The
crazier
I
turn
into

ticking
by
your
call
You're
the
wiser
one,
disguised
from
greed
And
I'm
just
a
child
who
longs
on
her
knees
But
I
found
a
boy
who
I
love
more
Than
I
ever
did
you
before
So
stand
beside
the
river
I
cried
And
lay
yourself
down
Look
how
you
want
me
now
that
I
don't
need
you
So
you
thought
that
I'd
crumble
to
my
knees
At
the
first
sight
of
you
crawling
back
to
me
To
whisper,
"Will
you
leave
your
man?"
'Cause
you
swear
that
this
time
you
can
stand
by
me
I
won't
stand
by
you
'Cause
I
found
a
boy
who
I
love
more
Than
I
ever
did
you
before
So
stand
beside
the
river
I
cried
And
lay
yourself
down
Look
how
you
want
me
now
that
I
don't
need
you
You
might
also
like
I
ain't
yours
for
no
taking
You
must
be
mistaken
I
could
never
look
into
your
eyes
And
settle
for
wrong
and
ignore
the
right
When
I
found
a
boy
who
loves
me
more
Than
you
ever
did
before
So
stand
beside
the
river
you
cried
And
lay
yourself
down
Look
how
you
want
me
now,
but
I
don't
need

Lyrics
Who
wants
to
be
right
as
rain?
It's
better
when
something
is
wrong
You
get
excitement
in
your
bones
And
everything
you
do's
a
game
When
night
comes,
and
you're
on
your
own
You
can
say,
"I
chose
to
be
alone"
Who
wants
to
be
right
as
rain?
It's
harder
when
you're
on
top
'Cause
when
hard
work
don't
pay
off
and
I'm
tired
There
ain't
no
room
in
my
bed,
as
far
as
I'm
concerned
So
wipe
that
dirty
smile
off
We
won't
be
making
up,
I've
cried
my
heart
out
And
now
I've
had
enough
of
love
Who
wants
to
be
riding
high
When
you'll
just
crumble
back
on
down?
You
give
up
everything
you
are
And
even
then,
you
don't
get
far
They
make
believe
that
everything
Is
exactly
what
it
seems
But
at
least
when
you're
at
your
worst
You
know
how

then
When

Wait,
do
you
see
my
heart
on
my
sleeve?
It's
been
there
for
days
on
end
And
it's
been
waitin'
for
you
to
open
up
yours,
too
Baby,
come
on
now,
I'm
trying
to
tell
you
just
how
I'd
like
to
hear
the
words
roll
out
of
your
mouth
finally
Say
that
it's
always
been
me
That's
made
you
feel
a
way
you've
never
felt
before
And
I'm
all
you
need
and
that
you
never
want
more
Then
you'd
say
all
of
the
right
things
without
a
clue
But
you'd
save
the
best
for
last
like
I'm
the
one
for
you
You
should
know
that
you're
just
a
temporary
fix
This
is
not
rooted
with
you,
it
don't
mean
that
much
to
me
You're
just
a
filler
in
the
space
that
happened
to
be
free
How
dare
you
think
you'd
get
away
with
tryin'
to
play
me,
yeah?
Why
is
it
every
time
I
think
I've
tried
my
hardest
It
turns
out
it
ain't
enough?
You're
still
not
mentioning
love
What
am
I
supposed
to
do
to
make
you
want
me
properly?
I'm
takin'
these
chances
and
getting
nowhere
And
though
I'm
trying
my
hardest,
you
go
back
to
her
And
I
think
that
I
know
things
may
never
change
I'm
still
hopin'
one
day
I
might
hear
you
say
You
might
also
like
I
make
you
feel
a
way
you've
never
felt
before
And
I'm
all
you
need
and
that
you
never
want
more
Then
you'd
say
all

But,
despite
the
truth
that
I
know
I
find
it
hard
to
let
go
and
give
up
on
you
Seems
I
love
the
things
you
do
Like
the
meaner
you
treat
me,
more
eager
I
am
To
persist
with
this
heartbreak
of
runnin'
around
And
I
will
do
until
I'm
findin'
myself
with
you
And
make
you
feel
a
way
you've
never
felt
before
And
be
all
you
need
so
that
you
never
want
more
Then
you'd

And
you'll

Lyrics
You've
got
your
eye
on
me
after
all
these
years
You
think
that
I
can't
see
you
from
over
here
I
may
be
out
of
your
view,
but
I
can
hear
you
I
may
be
out
of
the
room,
but
I
can
see
you
I
know
you
still
want
me,
you
always
will
And
I
can
guarantee
I
know
just
how
it
feels
To
never
be
free
completely
Sometimes
you
just
feel
so
empty
Like
lately
when
I
have
been
missing
you
And
I
would
still
do
anything
for
you
But
we
need
to
learn
how
to
love
who
we're
loving
It's
hard
but
we
must
we've
got
to
let
it
go
And
turn
off
the
urge
to
know
what
could
have
been
But
I
will
love
you
forever
I
was
far
too
reckless,
I
know
that
now
Trying
to
make
you
jealous
made
me
feel
proud
But
now
I'm
in
too
deep
to
climb
out
But
know
that
I
live
with
my
doubt,
oh-oh
You
might
also
like
Like
lately
when
I
have
been
missing
you
And
I
want
to
do
everything
with
you
But
we
need
to
learn
how
to
love
who
we're
loving
It's
hard
but
we
must,
we've
got
to
let
it
go
And
turn
off
the
urge
to
know
what
could
have
been
But
I
will
love
you
forever
Since
we
were
together
everybody's
changed
Our
reflections
in
the
mirror
no
longer
look
the
same
And
we're
only
just
beginning
to
live
the
lives
we'll
make
But
I
will
always
miss
you
at
the
end
of
each
day
But
we
need
to
learn
how
to
love
who
we're
loving
It's
hard
but
we
must,
we've

It's
so
hard

we
must,
we've

let
it
go
And

off
the

No,
