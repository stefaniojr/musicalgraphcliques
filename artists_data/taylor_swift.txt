Lyrics
Vintage
tee,
brand
new
phone
High
heels
on
cobblestones
When
you
are
young,
they
assume
you
know
nothing
Sequin
smile,
black
lipstick
Sensual
politics
When
you
are
young,
they
assume
you
know
nothing
But
I
knew
you
Dancin'
in
your
Levi's
Drunk
under
a
streetlight,
I
I
knew
you
Hand
under
my
sweatshirt
Baby,
kiss
it
better,
I
And
when
I
felt
like
I
was
an
old
cardigan
Under
someone's
bed
You
put
me
on
and
said
I
was
your
favorite
A
friend
to
all
is
a
friend
to
none
Chase
two
girls,
lose
the
one
When
you
are
young,
they
assume
you
know
nothing
You
might
also
like
But
I
knew
you
Playing
hide-and-seek
and
Giving
me
your
weekends,
I
I
knew
you
Your
heartbeat
on
the
High
Line
Once
in
twenty
lifetimes,
I
And
when
I
felt
like
I
was
an
old
cardigan
Under
someone's
bed
You
put
me
on
and
said
I
was
your
favorite
To
kiss
in
cars
and
downtown
bars
Was
all
we
needed
You
drew
stars
around
my
scars
But
now
I'm
bleedin'
'Cause
I
knew
you
Steppin'
on
the
last
train
Marked
me
like
a
bloodstain,
I
I
knew
you
Tried
to
change
the
ending
Peter
losing
Wendy,
I
I
knew
you
Leavin'
like
a
father
Running
like
water,
I
And
when
you
are
young,
they
assume
you
know
nothing
But
I
knew
you'd
linger
like
a
tattoo
kiss
I
knew
you'd
haunt
all
of
my
what-ifs
The
smell
of
smoke
would
hang
around
this
long
'Cause
I
knew
everything
when
I
was
young
I
knew
I'd
curse
you
for
the
longest
time
Chasin'
shadows
in
the
grocery
line
I
knew
you'd
miss
me
once
the
thrill
expired
And
you'd
be
standin'
in
my
front
porch
light
And
I
knew
you'd
come
back
to
me
You'd
come
back
to
me
And
you'd
come
back
to
me
And
you'd
come
back
And
when
I
felt
like
I
was
an
old
cardigan
Under
someone's
bed
You
put
me
on
and
said
I
was
your

Lyrics
I
can
see
you
standing,
honey
With
his
arms
around
your
body
Laughin',
but
the
joke's
not
funny
at
all
And
it
took
you
five
whole
minutes
To
pack
us
up
and
leave
me
with
it
Holdin'
all
this
love
out
here
in
the
hall
I
think
I've
seen
this
film
before
And
I
didn't
like
the
ending
You're
not
my
homeland
anymore
So
what
am
I
defending
now?
You
were
my
town,
now
I'm
in
exile,
seein'
you
out
I
think
I've
seen
this
film
before
Ooh,
ooh,
ooh
I
can
see
you
starin',
honey
Like
he's
just
your
understudy
Like
you'd
get
your
knuckles
bloody
for
me
Second,
third,
and
hundredth
chances
Balancin'
on
breaking
branches
Those
eyes
add
insult
to
injury
You
might
also
like
I
think
I've
seen
this
film
before
And
I
didn't
like
the
ending
I'm
not
your
problem
anymore
So
who
am
I
offending
now?
You
were
my
crown,
now
I'm
in
exile,
seein'
you
out
I
think
I've
seen
this
film
before
So
I'm
leaving
out
the
side
door
So
step
right
out,
there
is
no
amount
Of
crying
I
can
do
for
you
All
this
time
We
always
walked
a
very
thin
line
You
didn't
even
hear
me
out
(You
didn't
even
hear
me
out)
You
never
gave
a
warning
sign
(I
gave
so
many
signs)
All
this
time
I
never
learned
to
read
your
mind
(Never
learned
to
read
my
mind)
I
couldn't
turn
things
around
(You
never
turned
things
around)
'Cause
you
never
gave
a
warning

(I
gave
so

So
many
signs,
so
many
signs
You
didn't
even
see
the
signs
I
think
I've
seen
this
film
before
And
I
didn't
like
the
ending
You're
not
my
homeland
anymore
So
what
am
I
defending
now?
You
were
my
town,
now
I'm
in

seein'

Lyrics
We
could
leave
the
Christmas
lights
up
'til
January
And
this
is
our
place,
we
make
the
rules
And
there's
a
dazzling
haze,
a
mysterious
way
about
you,
dear
Have
I
known
you
twenty
seconds
or
twenty
years?
Can
I
go
where
you
go?
Can
we
always
be
this
close?
Forever
and
ever,
ah
Take
me
out
and
take
me
home
You're
my,
my,
my,
my
lover
We
could
let
our
friends
crash
in
the
living
room
This
is
our
place,
we
make
the
call
And
I'm
highly
suspicious
that
everyone
who
sees
you
wants
you
I've
loved
you
three
summers
now,
honey,
but
I
want
'em
all
Can
I
go
where
you
go?
Can
we
always
be
this
close?
Forever
and
ever,
ah
Take
me
out
and
take
me
home
(Forever
and
ever)
You're
my,
my,
my,
my
lover
You
might
also
like
Ladies
and
gentlemen,
will
you
please
stand?
With
every
guitar
string
scar
on
my
hand
I
take
this
magnetic
force
of
a
man
to
be
my
lover
My
heart's
been
borrowed
and
yours
has
been
blue
All's
well
that
ends
well
to
end
up
with
you
Swear
to
be
overdramatic
and
true
to
my
lover
And
you'll
save
all
your
dirtiest
jokes
for
me
And
at
every
table,
I'll
save
you
a
seat,
lover
Can
I
go
where
you
go?
Can
we
always
be
this
close?
Forever
and
ever,
ah
Take
me
out
and
take
me
home
(Forever
and
ever)
You're
my,

Oh,
you're

you're

Lyrics
I'm
doing
good,
I'm
on
some
new
shit
Been
saying
"yes"
instead
of
"no"
I
thought
I
saw
you
at
the
bus
stop,
I
didn't
though
I
hit
the
ground
running
each
night
I
hit
the
Sunday
matinée
You
know
the
greatest
films
of
all
time
were
never
made
I
guess
you
never
know,
never
know
And
if
you
wanted
me,
you
really
should've
showed
And
if
you
never
bleed,
you're
never
gonna
grow
And
it's
alright
now
But
we
were
something,
don't
you
think
so?
Roaring
twenties,
tossing
pennies
in
the
pool
And
if
my
wishes
came
true
It
would've
been
you
In
my
defense,
I
have
none
For
never
leaving
well
enough
alone
But
it
would've
been
fun
If
you
would've
been
the
one
(Ooh)
I
have
this
dream
you're
doing
cool
shit
Having
adventures
on
your
own
You
meet
some
woman
on
the
internet
and
take
her
home
We
never
painted
by
the
numbers,
baby
But
we
were
making
it
count
You
know
the
greatest
loves
of
all
time
are
over
now
You
might
also
like
I
guess
you
never
know,
never
know
And
it's
another
day
waking
up
alone
But
we
were
something,
don't
you
think
so?
Roaring
twenties,
tossing
pennies
in
the
pool
And
if
my
wishes
came
true
It
would've
been
you
In
my
defense,
I
have
none
For
never
leaving
well
enough
alone
But
it
would've
been
fun
If
you
would've
been
the
one
I,
I,
I
persist
and
resist
the
temptation
to
ask
you
If
one
thing
had
been
different
Would
everything
be
different
today?
We
were
something,
don't
you
think
so?
Rosé
flowing
with
your
chosen
family
And
it
would've
been
sweet
If
it
could've
been
me
In
my
defense,
I
have
none
For
digging
up
the
grave
another
time
But
it
would've
been
fun
If
you
would've
been
the
one
(Ooh)101Embed

Lyrics
Salt
air,
and
the
rust
on
your
door
I
never
needed
anything
more
Whispers
of
"Are
you
sure?"
"Never
have
I
ever
before"
But
I
can
see
us
lost
in
the
memory
August
slipped
away
into
a
moment
in
time
'Cause
it
was
never
mine
And
I
can
see
us
twisted
in
bedsheets
August
sipped
away
like
a
bottle
of
wine
'Cause
you
were
never
mine
Your
back
beneath
the
sun
Wishin'
I
could
write
my
name
on
it
Will
you
call
when
you're
back
at
school?
I
remember
thinkin'
I
had
you
But
I
can
see
us
lost
in
the
memory
August
slipped
away
into
a
moment
in
time
'Cause
it
was
never
mine
And
I
can

August
sipped

'Cause
you
were

You
might
also
like
Back
when
we
were
still
changin'
for
the
better
Wanting
was
enough
For
me,
it
was
enough
To
live
for
the
hope
of
it
all
Cancel
plans
just
in
case
you'd
call
And
say,
"Meet
me
behind
the
mall"
So
much
for
summer
love
and
saying
"us"
'Cause
you
weren't
mine
to
lose
You
weren't
mine
to
lose,
no
But
I
can
see
us
lost
in
the
memory
August
slipped
away
into
a

'Cause
it
was

And
I
can

twisted

sipped

'Cause
you

'Cause
you
were
never
mine
Never
mine
But
do
you
remember?
Remember
when
I
pulled
up
and
said
"Get
in
the
car"
And
then
canceled
my

What
You
Made
Me
Do
Lyrics
I
don't
like
your
little
games
Don't
like
your
tilted
stage
The
role
you
made
me
play
Of
the
fool,
no,
I
don't
like
you
I
don't
like
your
perfect
crime
How
you
laugh
when
you
lie
You
said

gun
was
mine
Isn't
cool,
no,
I
don't
like
you
(Oh)
But
I
got
smarter,
I
got
harder
in
the
nick
of
time
Honey,
I
rose
up
from
the
dead,
I
do
it
all
the
time
I've
got
a
list
of
names
and
yours
is
in

I
check
it

They

You
asked

for

to
sleep
Locked
me
out
and
threw
a
feast
(What?)
The
world
moves
on,
another
day,
another
drama,
drama
But
not
for
me,
not
for
me,
all
I
think
about
is
karma
And
then
the
world
moves
on,
but
one
thing's
for
sure
Maybe
I
got
mine,
but
you'll
all

yours

Lyrics
Betty,
I
won't
make
assumptions
About
why
you
switched
your
homeroom,
but
I
think
it's
'cause
of
me
Betty,
one
time
I
was
riding
on
my
skateboard
When
I
passed
your
house
It's
like
I
couldn't
breathe
You
heard
the
rumors
from
Inez
You
can't
believe
a
word
she
says
Most
times,
but
this
time
it
was
true
The
worst
thing
that
I
ever
did
Was
what
I
did
to
you
But
if
I
just
showed
up
at

party
Would
you
have
me?
Would
you
want
me?
Would
you
tell
me
to
go
fuck
myself
Or
lead
me
to
the
garden?
In
the
garden,
would
you
trust
me
If
I
told
you
it
was
just
a
summer
thing?
I'm
only
seventeen,
I
don't
know
anything
But
I
know
I
miss
you
Betty,
I
know
where
it
all
went
wrong
Your
favorite
song
was
playing
From
the
far
side
of
the
gym
I
was
nowhere
to
be
found
I
hate
the
crowds,
you
know
that
Plus,
I
saw
you
dance
with
him
You
might
also
like
You
heard
the
rumors
from
Inez
You
can't
believe
a
word
she
says
Most
times,
but
this
time
it
was
true
The
worst
thing
that
I
ever
did
Was
what
I
did
to
you
But
if
I
just
showed
up
at
your
party
Would
you
have
me?
Would
you
want
me?
Would
you
tell
me
to
go
fuck
myself
Or

to

In

I'm
only
seventeen,
I
don't
know
anything
But
I
know
I
miss
you
I
was
walking
home
on
broken
cobblestones
Just
thinking
of
you
when
she
pulled
up
like
A
figment
of
my
worst
intentions
She
said
"James,
get
in,
let's
drive"
Those
days
turned
into
nights
Slept
next
to
her,
but
I
dreamt
of
you
all
summer
long
Betty,
I'm
here
on
your
doorstep
And
I
planned
it
out
for
weeks
now
But
it's
finally
sinkin'
in
Betty,
right
now
is
the
last
time
I
can
dream
about
what
happens
when
You
see
my
face
again
The
only
thing
I
wanna
do
Is
make
it
up
to
you
So
I
showed
up
at
your
party
Yeah,
I
showed
up
at
your
party
Yeah,
I
showed
up
at
your
party
Will
you
have
me?
Will
you
love
me?
Will
you
kiss
me
on
the
porch
In
front
of
all
your
stupid
friends?
If
you
kiss
me,
will
it
be
just
like
I
dreamed
it?
Will
it
patch
your
broken
wings?
I'm
only
seventeen,
I
don't
know
anything
But
I
know
I
miss
you
Standing
in
your
cardigan
Kissin'
in
my
car
again
Stopped
at
a
streetlight
You
know

Lyrics
You
booked
the
night
train
for
a
reason
So
you
could
sit
there
in
this
hurt
Bustling
crowds
or
silent
sleepers
You're
not
sure
which
is
worse
Because
I
dropped
your
hand
while
dancing
Left
you
out
there
standing
Crestfallen
on
the
landing
Champagne
problems
Your
mom's
ring
in
your
pocket
My
picture
in
your
wallet
Your
heart
was
glass,
I
dropped
it
Champagne
problems
You
told
your
family
for
a
reason
You
couldn't
keep
it
in
Your
sister
splashed
out
on
the
bottle
Now
no
one's
celebrating
Dom
Pérignon,
you
brought
it
No
crowd
of
friends
applauded
Your
hometown
skeptics
called
it
Champagne
problems
You
had
a
speech,
you're
speechless
Love
slipped
beyond
your
reaches
And
I
couldn't
give
a
reason
Champagne
problems
You
might
also
like
Your
Midas
touch
on
the
Chevy
door
November
flush
and
your
flannel
cure
"This
dorm
was
once
a
madhouse"
I
made
a
joke,
"Well,
it's
made
for
me"
How
evergreen,
our
group
of
friends
Don't
think
we'll
say
that
word
again
And
soon
they'll
have
the
nerve
to
deck
the
halls
That
we
once
walked
through
One
for
the
money,
two
for
the
show
I
never
was
ready
so
I
watch
you
go
Sometimes
you
just
don't
know
the
answer
'Til
someone's
on
their
knees
and
asks
you
"She
would've
made
such
a
lovely
bride
What
a
shame
she's
fucked
in
the
head,"
they
said
But
you'll
find
the
real
thing
instead
She'll
patch
up
your
tapestry
that
I
shred
And
hold
your
hand
while
dancing
Never
leave
you
standing
Crestfallen
on
the
landing
With
champagne
problems
Your
mom's
ring
in
your
pocket
Her
picture
in

You
won't

Nice
to
meet
you,
where
you
been?
I
could
show
you
incredible
things
Magic,
madness,
heaven,
sin
Saw
you
there
and
I
thought
"Oh,
my
God,
look
at
that
face
You
look
like
my
next
mistake
Love's
a
game,
wanna
play?"
Ayy
New
money,
suit
and
tie
I
can
read
you
like
a
magazine
Ain't
it
funny?
Rumors
fly
And
I
know
you
heard
about
me
So,
hey,
let's
be
friends
I'm
dying
to
see
how
this
one
ends
Grab
your
passport
and
my
hand
I
can
make
the
bad
guys
good
for
a
weekend
So,
it's
gonna
be
forever
Or
it's
gonna
go
down
in
flames?
You
can
tell
me

it's

was

you
I'm

'Cause

I
love
the

And
you
love
the

'Cause
we're
young

And
I'll

Cherry

crystal
skies
I
could
show
you
incredible
things
Stolen
kisses,
pretty
lies
You're
the
king,
baby,
I'm
your
queen
Find
out
what
you
want
Be
that
girl

Wait,

to

Screaming,

turn
Rose
garden
filled
with
thorns
Keep
you
second
guessing,
like
"Oh,
my
God,
who
is
she?"
I
get
drunk
on
jealousy
But
you'll
come
back
each
time
you
leave
'Cause,

I'm

Lyrics
I
have
this
thing
where
I
get
older,
but
just
never
wiser
Midnights
become
my
afternoons
When
my
depression
works
the
graveyard
shift,
all
of
the
people
I've
ghosted
stand
there
in
the
room
I
should
not
be
left
to
my
own
devices
They
come
with
prices
and
vices
I
end
up
in
crisis
(Tale
as
old
as
time)
I
wake
up
screaming
from
dreaming
One
day,
I'll
watch
as
you're
leaving
'Cause
you
got
tired
of
my
scheming
(For
the
last
time)
It's
me,
hi
I'm
the
problem,
it's
me
At
teatime,
everybody
agrees
I'll
stare
directly
at
the
sun,
but
never
in
the
mirror
It
must
be
exhausting
always
rooting
for
the
anti-hero
Sometimes,
I
feel
like
everybody
is
a
sexy
baby
And
I'm
a
monster
on
the
hill
Too
big
to
hang
out,
slowly
lurching
toward
your
favorite
city
Pierced
through
the
heart,
but
never
killed
You
might
also
like
Did
you
hear
my
covert
narcissism
I
disguise
as
altruism
Like
some
kind
of
congressman?
(A
tale
as
old
as
time)
I
wake
up
screaming
from
dreaming
One
day,
I'll
watch
as
you're
leaving
And
life
will
lose
all
its
meaning
(For
the
last
time)
It's
me,
hi
I'm
the
problem,
it's
me

it's

At

I'll
stare

never

the
mirror
It
must
be
exhausting
always
rooting
for
the
anti-hero
I
have
this
dream
my
daughter-in-law
kills
me
for
the
money
She
thinks
I
left
them
in
the
will
The
family
gathers
'round
and
reads
it
and
then
someone
screams
out
"She's
laughing
up
at
us
from
Hell"
It's
me,
hi
I'm
the
problem,
it's

It's
me,
hi
I'm

it's

It's

Everybody

It's

it’s
easier

ignore

believe

Even
when
we'd

we'd
not

We
gather
here,
we
line
up,
weepin'
in
a
sunlit
room
And
if
I'm
on
fire,
you'll
be

Even

'Til

day
I

And
you're
the

flying
around,
saving
face
And
if
I'm
dead

you,
why
are
you
at
the
wake?
Cursing
my

wishing
I
stayed
Look
at

my
tears
ricochet
We
gather
stones,
never
knowing
what
they'll
mean
Some
to
throw,
some
to
make

You
know
I
didn't
want
to
have
to

But
what
a

You
wear
the
same
jewels
that
I

you
As
you
bury
me
I
didn't
have
it
in
myself
to
go

'Cause
when
I'd
fight,
you
used
to
tell
me
I
was

And
if

dead

why

Cursing

ricochet

And
I
still
talk

(When
I'm

And
when
you
can't
sleep
at

(You
hear

I
didn't

it

to

And
so
the

sink
beneath

You
had

it
killed
you
just
the

Cursing

You

And
you're
tossing

drunk
on

Crossing

And
you're

Midnight
You
come
and
pick
me
up,
no
headlights
A
long
drive
Could
end
in
burning
flames
or
paradise
Fade
into
view,
oh
It's
been
a
while
since
I
have
even
heard
from
you
(Heard
from
you)
And
I
should
just
tell
you
to
leave
'Cause
I
know
exactly
where
it
leads
But
I
watch
us
go
'round
and
'round
each
time
You
got
that
James
Dean
daydream
look
in
your
eye
And
I
got
that
red
lip
classic
thing
that
you
like
And
when
we
go
crashing
down,
we
come
back
every
time
'Cause
we
never
go
out
of
style,
we
never
go
out

You
got
that
long
hair,
slicked
back,
white
t-shirt
And
I
got
that
good
girl
faith
and
a
tight
little

And

we
come

'Cause

He

Takes

The

You

No

Hang

I

And
you're

I
tend

it

me
I
know
you
never
get
just
what
you
see
But
I
will
never
bore
you,
baby
(And
there's
a
lotta
lame
guys
out
there)
And
when
we
had
that
fight
out
in
the
rain
You
ran

Lyrics
You
say,
"I
don't
understand,"
and
I
say,
"I
know
you
don't"
We
thought
a
cure
would
come
through
in
time,
now,
I
fear
it
won't
Remember
lookin'
at
this
room,
we
loved
it
'cause
of
the
light
Now,
I
just
sit
in
the
dark
and
wonder
if
it's
time
Do
I
throw
out
everything
we
built
or
keep
it?
I'm
getting
tired
even
for
a
phoenix
Always
risin'
from
the
ashes
Mendin'
all
her
gashes
You
might
just
have
dealt
the
final
blow
Stop,
you're
losin'
me
Stop,
you're
losin'
me
Stop,
you're
losin'
me
I
can't
find
a
pulse
My
heart
won't
start
anymore
for
you
'Cause
you're
losin'
me
Every
mornin',
I
glared
at
you
with
storms
in
my
eyes
How
can
you
say
that
you
love
someone
you
can't
tell
is
dyin'?
I
sent
you
signals
and
bit
my
nails
down
to
the
quick
My
face
was
gray,
but
you
wouldn't
admit
that
we
were
sick
You
might
also
like
And
the
air
is
thick
with
loss
and
indecision
I
know
my
pain
is
such
an
imposition
Now,
you're
runnin'
down
the
hallway
And
you
know
what
they
all
say
"You
don't
know
what
you
got
until
it's
gone"
Stop,
you're
losin'
me
Stop,
you're
losin'
me
Stop,
you're
losin'
me
I
can't
find
a
pulse
My
heart
won't
start
anymore
for
you
'Cause
you're
losin'
me
'Cause
you're
losin'
me
Stop
(Stop)
'cause
you're
losin'
me
My
heart
won't
start

(Stop
'cause
you're
losin'
me)
My

won't

(Stop
'cause

How
long
could
we
be
a
sad
song
'Til

I
gave

my

And
all

I

I'm

Lyrics
Green
was
the
color
of
the
grass
Where
I
used
to
read
at
Centennial
Park
I
used
to
think
I
would
meet
somebody
there
Teal
was
the
color
of
your
shirt
When
you
were
sixteen
at
the
yogurt
shop
You
used
to
work
at
to
make
a
little
money
Time,
curious
time
Gave
me
no
compasses,
gave
me
no
signs
Were
there
clues
I
didn't
see?
And
isn't
it
just
so
pretty
to
think
All
along
there
was
some
Invisible
string
Tying
you
to
me?
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Bad
was
the
blood
of
the
song
in
the
cab
On
your
first
trip
to
LA
You
ate
at
my
favorite
spot
for
dinner
Bold
was
the
waitress
on
our
three-year
trip
Getting
lunch
down
by
the
Lakes
She
said
I
looked
like
an
American
singer
You
might
also
like
Time,
mystical
time
Cutting
me
open,
then
healing
me
fine
Were
there
clues
I
didn't
see?
And
isn't
it
just
so
pretty
to
think
All
along
there
was
some
Invisible
string
Tying
you
to
me?
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
A
string
that
pulled
me
Out
of
all
the
wrong
arms,
right
into
that
dive
bar
Something
wrapped
all
of
my
past
mistakes
in
barbed
wire
Chains
around
my
demons
Wool
to
brave
the
seasons
One
single
thread
of
gold
Tied
me
to
you
Cold
was
the
steel
of
my
axe
to
grind
For
the
boys
who
broke
my
heart
Now
I
send
their
babies
presents
Gold
was
the
color
of
the
leaves
When
I
showed
you
around
Centennial
Park
Hell
was
the
journey
but
it
brought
me
heaven
Time,
wondrous
time
Gave
me
the
blues
and
then
purple-pink
skies
And
it's
cool
Baby,
with
me
And
isn't
it
just
so
pretty
to
think
All
along
there
was
some
Invisible
string
Tying
you
to
me?

Lyrics
When
the
morning
came
We
were
cleaning
incense
off
your
vinyl
shelf
'Cause
we
lost
track
of
time
again
Laughing
with
my
feet
in
your
lap
Like
you
were
my
closest
friend
"How'd
we
end
up
on
the
floor,
anyway?"
you
say
"Your
roommate's
cheap-ass
screw-top
rosé,
that's
how"
I
see
you
every
day
now
And
I
chose
you
The
one
I
was
dancing
with
In
New
York,
no
shoes
Looked
up
at
the
sky
and
it
was
The
burgundy
on
my
t-shirt
When
you
splashed
your
wine
into
me
And
how
the
blood
rushed
into
my
cheeks
So
scarlet,
it
was
The
mark
thеy
saw
on
my
collarbone
The
rust
that
grew
bеtween
telephones
The
lips
I
used
to
call
home
So
scarlet,
it
was
maroon
When
the
silence
came
We
were
shaking,
blind
and
hazy
How
the
hell
did
we
lose
sight
of
us
again?
Sobbing
with
your
head
in
your
hands
Ain't
that
the
way
shit
always
ends?
You
were
standing
hollow-eyed
in
the
hallway
Carnations
you
had
thought
were
roses,
that's
us
I
feel
you,
no
matter
what
The
rubies
that
I
gave
up
You
might
also
like
And
I
lost
you
The
one
I
was
dancing
with
In
New
York,
no
shoes
Looked
up
at
the
sky
and
it
was
(Maroon)
The
burgundy
on
my
t-shirt
When
you
splashed
your
wine
into
me
And
how
the
blood
rushed
into
my
cheeks
So
scarlet,

So

it
was

And
I
wake
with
your
memory
over
me
That's
a
real
fucking
legacy,
legacy
(It
was
maroon)
And
I
wake
with
your
memory
over
me
That's
a
real
fucking
legacy
to
leave
The
burgundy
on
my
t-shirt
When
you
splashed
your
wine
into
me
And
how
the
blood
rushed
into

So

Well
Lyrics
I
walked
through
the
door
with
you,
the
air
was
cold
But
something
'bout
it
felt
like
home
somehow
And
I
left
my
scarf
there
at
your
sister's
house
And
you've
still
got
it
in
your
drawer,
even
now
Oh,
your
sweet
disposition
and
my
wide-eyed
gaze
We're
singing
in
the
car,
getting
lost
upstate
Autumn
leaves
falling
down
like
pieces
into
place
And
I
can
picture
it
after
all
these
days
And
I
know
it's
long
gone
and
That
magic's
not
here
no
more
And
I
might
be
okay,
but
I'm
not
fine
at
all
Oh,
oh,
oh
'Cause
there
we
are
again
on
that
little
town
street
You
almost
ran
the
red
'cause
you
were
lookin'
over
at
me
Wind
in
my
hair,
I
was
there
I
remember
it
all
too
well
Photo
album
on
the
counter,
your
cheeks
were
turning
red
You
used
to
be
a
little
kid
with
glasses
in
a
twin-sized
bed
And
your
mother's
telling
stories
'bout
you
on
the
tee-ball
team
You
taught
me
'bout
your
past,
thinking
your
future
was
me
You
might
also
like
And
I
know
it's
long
gone
and
There
was
nothing
else
I
could
do
And
I
forget
about
you
long
enough
To
forget
why
I
needed
to
'Cause
there
we
are
again
in
the
middle
of
the
night
We're
dancing
‘round
the
kitchen
in
the
refrigerator
light
Down
the
stairs,
I
was
there
I
remember
it
all
too
well,
yeah
Well,
maybe
we
got
lost
in
translation
Maybe
I
asked
for
too
much
But
maybe
this
thing
was
a
masterpiece
'Til
you
tore
it
all
up
Running
scared,
I
was
there
I
remember
it
all
too
well
And
you
call
me
up
again
Just
to
break
me
like
a
promise
So
casually
cruel
in
the
name
of
being
honest
I'm
a
crumpled
up
piece
of
paper
lying
here
'Cause
I
remember
it
all,
all,
all
Too
well
Time
won't
fly,
it's
like
I'm
paralyzed
by
it
I'd
like
to
be
my
old
self
again,
but
I'm
still
trying
to
find
it
After
plaid
shirt
days
and
nights
when
you
made
me
your
own
Now,
you
mail
back
my
things
and
I
walk
home
alone
But
you
keep
my
old
scarf
from
that
very
first
week
'Cause
it
reminds
you
of
innocence
and
it
smells
like
me
You
can't
get
rid
of
it
'Cause
you
remember
it
all
too
well,
yeah
'Cause
there
we
are
again
when
I
loved
you
so
Back
before
you
lost
the
one
real

you've
ever

It's
okay,
we're
the
best
of
friends
Anyway
I
hear
it
in
your
voice,
you're
smoking
with
your
boys
I
touch
my
phone
as
if
it's
your
face
I
didn't
choose
this
town,
I
dream
of
getting
out
There's
just
one
who
could
make
me
stay
All
my
days
From
sprinkler
splashes
to
fireplace
ashes
I
waited
ages
to
see
you
there
I
search
the
party
of
better
bodies
Just
to
learn
that
you
never
cared
You're
on
your
own,
kid
You
always
have
been
I
see
the
great
escape,
so
long,
Daisy
May
I
picked
the
petals,
he
loves
me
not
Something
different
bloomed,
writing
in
my
room
I
play
my
songs
in
the
parking
lot
I'll
run
away
You
might
also
like
From
sprinkler
splashes
to
fireplace
ashes
I
called
a
taxi
to
take
me
there
I
search
the
party
of
better
bodies
Just
to
learn
that
my
dreams
aren't
rare
You're
on
your
own,
kid
You
always
have
been
From
sprinkler
splashes
to
fireplace
ashes
I
gave
my
blood,
sweat,
and
tears
for
this
I
hosted
parties
and
starved
my
body
Like
I'd
be
saved
by
a
perfect
kiss
The
jokes
weren't
funny,
I
took
the
money
My
friends
from
home
don't
know
what
to
say
I
looked
around
in
a
blood-soaked
gown
And
I
saw
something
they
can't
take
away
'Cause
there
were
pages
turned
with
the
bridges
burned
Everything
you
lose
is
a
step
you
take
So,
make
the
friendship
bracelets,
take
the
moment
and
taste
it
You've
got
no
reason
to
be
afraid
You're
on
your
own,
kid
Yeah,
you
can
face
this
You're
on
your
own,
kid
You
always
have
been41Embed

Lyrics
Honey,
when
I'm
above
the
trees
I
see
this
for
what
it
is
But
now
I'm
right
down
in
it,
all
the
years
I've
given
Is
just
shit
we're
dividin'
up
Showed
you
all
of
my
hiding
spots
I
was
dancing
when
the
music
stopped
And
in
the
disbelief,
I
can't
face
reinvention
I
haven't
met
the
new
me
yet
There'll
be
happiness
after
you
But
there
was
happiness
because
of
you
Both
of
these
things
can
be
true
There
is
happiness
Past
the
blood
and
bruise
Past
the
curses
and
cries
Beyond
the
terror
in
the
nightfall
Haunted
by
the
look
in
my
eyes
That
would've
loved
you
for
a
lifetime
Leave
it
all
behind
And
there
is
happiness
Tell
me,
when
did
your
winning
smile
Begin
to
look
like
a
smirk?
When
did
all
our
lessons
start
to
look
like
weapons
Pointed
at
my
deepest
hurt?
I
hope
she'll
be
a
beautiful
fool
Who
takes
my
spot
next
to
you
No,
I
didn't
mean
that
Sorry,
I
can't
see
facts
through
all
of
my
fury
You
haven't
met
the
new
me
yet
You
might
also
like
There'll
be
happiness
after
me
But
there
was
happiness
because
of
me
Both
of
these
things,
I
believe
There
is
happiness
In
our
history,
across
our
great
divide
There
is
a
glorious
sunrise
Dappled
with
the
flickers
of
light
From
the
dress
I
wore
at
midnight,
leave
it
all
behind
And
there
is
happiness
I
can't
make
it
go
away
by
making
you
a
villain
I
guess
it's
the
price
I
paid
for
seven
years
in
Heaven
And
I
pulled
your
body
into
mine
Every
goddamn
night,
now
I
get
fake
niceties
No
one
teaches
you
what
to
do
When
a
good
man
hurts
you
And
you
know
you
hurt
him
too
Honey,
when
I'm
above
the
trees
I
see
it
for
what
it
is
But
now
my
eyes
leak
acid
rain
on
the
pillow
where
you
used
to
lay
your
head
After
giving
you
the
best
I
had
Tell
me
what
to
give
after
that
All
you
want
from
me
now
is
the
green
light
of
forgiveness
You
haven't
met
the
new
me
yet
And
I
think
she'll
give
you
that
There'll
be
happiness
after
you
But
there
was
happiness
because
of
you
too
Both
of
these
things
can
be
true
There
is
happiness
In
our
history,
across
our
great
divide
There
is
a
glorious
sunrise
Dappled
with
the
flickers
of
light
From
the

wore
at
midnight,
leave
it
all
behind
Oh,
leave
it
all
behind
Leave
it
all
behind
And

Lyrics
I've
been
having
a
hard
time
adjusting
I
had
the
shiniest
wheels,
now
they're
rusting
I
didn't
know
if
you'd
care
if
I
came
back
I
have
a
lot
of
regrets
about
that
Pulled
the
car
off
the
road
to
the
lookout
Could've
followed
my
fears
all
the
way
down
And
maybe
I
don't
quite
know
what
to
say
But
I'm
here
in
your
doorway
I
just
wanted
you
to
know
that
this
is
me
trying
I
just
wanted
you
to
know
that
this
is
me
trying
They
told
me
all
of
my
cages
were
mental
So
I
got
wasted
like
all
my
potential
And
my
words
shoot
to
kill
when
I'm
mad
I
have
a
lot
of
regrets
about
that
I
was
so
ahead
of
the
curve,
the
curve
became
a
sphere
Fell
behind
all
my
classmates
and
I
ended
up
here
Pouring
out
my
heart
to
a
stranger
But
I
didn't
pour
the
whiskey
I
just
wanted

It's
hard
to
be

these
days
when
all
I
want
is
you
You're
a

in

on

And
I

Lyrics
I
remember
Good
girl,
sad
boy
Big
city,
wrong
choices
We
had
one
thing
goin'
on
I
swear
that
it
was
somethin'
'Cause
I
don't
remember
who
I
was
Before
you
painted
all
my
nights
A
color
I've
searched
for
since
But
one
thing
after
another
Fuckin'
situations,
circumstances
Miscommunications,
and
I
Have
to
say,
by
the
way
I
just
may
like
some
explanations
Can
I
ask
you
a
question?
Did
you
ever
have
someone
kiss
you
in
a
crowded
room
And
every
single
one
of
your
friends
was
makin'
fun
of
you
But
fifteen
seconds
later,
thеy
were
clappin'
too?
Then
what
did
you
do?
Did
you
lеave
her
house
in
the
middle
of
the
night?
Oh
Did
you
wish
you'd
put
up
more
of
a
fight,
oh
When
she
said
it
was
too
much?
Do
you
wish
you
could
still
touch
her?
It's
just
a
question
You
might
also
like
Half-moon
eyes,
bad
surprise
Did
you
realize
out
of
time?
She
was
on
your
mind
with
some
dickhead
guy
That
you
saw
that
night
But
you
were
on
somethin'
It
was
one
drink
after
another
Fuckin'
politics
and
gender
roles
And
you're
not
sure
and
I
don't
know
Got
swept
away
in
the
gray
I
just
may
like
to
have
a
conversation
Can
I
ask
you
a
question?
Did
you
ever

Oh
Did

put
up
more

oh
When
she
said
it
was
too
much?
Do
you
wish
you
could
still
touch
her?
It's
just
a
question
Does
it
feel
like
everything's
just
like
Second
best
after
that
meteor
strike?
And
what's
that
that
I
heard?
That
you're
still
with
her?
That's
nice,
I'm
sure
that's
what's
suitable
And
right,
but
tonight
Can
I
ask
you
a
question?

Story
Lyrics
We
were
both
young
when
I
first
saw
you
I
close
my
eyes,
and
the
flashback
starts
I'm
standing
there
On
a
balcony
in
summer
air
See
the
lights,
see
the
party,
the
ball
gowns
See
you
make
your
way
through
the
crowd
And
say,
"Hello"
Little
did
I
know
That
you
were
Romeo,
you
were
throwing
pebbles
And
my
daddy
said,
"Stay
away
from
Juliet"
And
I
was
crying
on
the
staircase
Begging
you,
"Please,
don't
go,"
and
I
said
Romeo,
take
me
somewhere
we
can
be
alone
I'll
be
waiting,
all
there's
left
to
do
is
run
You'll
be
the
prince
and
I'll
be
the
princess
It's
a
love
story,
baby,
just
say
"Yes"
So
I
sneak
out
to
the
garden
to
see
you
We
keep
quiet,
'cause
we're
dead
if
they
knew
So
close
your
eyes
Escape
this
town
for
a
little
while,
oh,
oh
You
might
also
like
'Cause
you
were
Romeo,
I
was
a
scarlet
letter
And
my
daddy
said,
"Stay
away
from
Juliet"
But
you
were
everything
to
me
I
was
begging
you,
"Please,
don't
go,"
and
I
said
Romeo,
take
me
somewhere
we
can
be

I'll
be

all
there's

is

You'll
be

and
I'll
be
the

It's
a
love
story,
baby,
just
say
"Yes"
Romeo,
save
me,
they're
trying
to
tell
me
how
to
feel
This
love
is
difficult,
but
it's
real
Don't
be
afraid,
we'll
make
it
out
of
this
mess
It's
a
love
story,
baby,
just
say
"Yes"
Oh,
oh
I
got
tired
of
waiting
Wondering
if
you
were
ever
coming
around
My
faith
in
you
was
fading
When
I
met
you
on
the
outskirts
of
town
And
I
said,
"Romeo,
save
me,
I've
been
feeling
so
alone
I
keep
waiting
for
you
but
you
never
come
Is
this
in
my
head?
I
don't
know
what
to
think"
He
knelt
to
the
ground
and
pulled
out
a
ring,
and
said
"Marry
me,
Juliet,
you'll
never
have
to
be
alone
I
love
you,
and
that's
all
I
really
know
I
talked
to
your
dad,
go
pick
out
a
white
dress
It's

On
The
Beach
Lyrics
One
night,
a
few
moons
ago
I
saw
flecks
of
what
could've
been
lights
But
it
might
just
have
been
you
Passing
by
unbeknownst
to
me
Life
is
emotionally
abusive
And
time
can't
stop
me
quite
like
you
did
And
my
flight
was
awful,
thanks
for
asking
I'm
unglued,
thanks
to
you
And
it's
like
snow
at
the
beach
Weird,
but
fuckin'
beautiful
Flying
in
a
dream
Stars
by
the
pocketful
You
wanting
me
Tonight
feels
impossible
But
it's
comin'
down
No
sound,
it's
all
around
Like
snow
on
the
beach
Like
snow
on
the
beach
Like
snow
on
the

Like
snow,
ah
You
might

like
This
scene
feels
like
what
I
once
saw
on
a
screen
I
searched
"aurora
borealis
green"
I've
never
seen
someone
lit
from
within
Blurring
out
my
periphery
My
smile
is
like
I
won
a
contest
And
to
hide
that
would
be
so
dishonest
And
it's
fine
to
fake
it
'til
you
make
it
'Til
you
do,
'til
it's
true
Now
it's
like
snow
at
the
beach
Weird,
but
fuckin'
beautiful
Flying
in
a
dream
Stars
by
the
pocketful
You
wanting
me
Tonight
feels
impossible
But
it's
comin'

No

it's

Like

I
(I)
don't

But
your

are
flying
saucers
from
another

Now
I'm
all
for
you

Janet
Can
this
be
a
real

Can
it?
Are

falling

snow

I
washed
my
hands
of

at
the
club
You
made
a
mess
of

I
pictured
you
with
other

in
love
Then
threw
up
on
the
street
Like
waiting
for
a
bus
that
never
shows
You
just
start
walkin'
on
They
say
that
if
it's
right,
you
know
Each

plays
our
song
Nothing
has
ever
felt

Oh,

Kens,
I'd

Rip

off

Freedom
felt

Now
the
sun
burns
my

the
sand
hurts
my
feelings
And
I
never

cry
(And
I

at

Yeah,
my
sadness
is

(My

You
were
the
one
that
I
loved
Don't
need
another
metaphor,
it's
simple
enough
A
wrinkle
in

like
the
crease
by
your
eyes
This
is
why
they
shouldn't
kill
off
the

Dreams

your

In

you

Is

How's
one
to
know?
I'd
meet
you
where
the
spirit
meets
the
bones
In
a
faith-forgotten
land
In
from
the
snow
Your
touch
brought
forth
an
incandescent
glow
Tarnished
but
so
grand
And
the
old
widow
goes
to
the
stone
every
day
But
I
don't,
I
just
sit
here
and
wait
Grieving
for
the

Oh,
goddamn
My
pain
fits
in
the
palm
of
your
freezing
hand
Taking
mine,
but
it's
been
promised
to
another
Oh,
I
can't
Stop
you
putting
roots
in
my
dreamland
My
house
of
stone,
your
ivy
grows
And
now
I'm
covered
in
you
I
wish

The
fatal
flaw
that
makes
you
long
to
be
Magnificently
cursed
He's
in

Your
opal

are
all
I
wish

He
wants

Clover

What
would

do
if

found
us
out?
Crescent
moon,
coast
is
clear
Spring
breaks
loose,
but
so
does
fear
He's
gonna
burn
this
house
to
the
ground
How's
one
to
know?
I'd
live
and
die
for
moments
that
we
stole
On
begged
and
borrowed
time
So
tell
me
to
run
Or
dare
to
sit

watch
what

I'm

I'll

tonight
I'll
get
you
out
on

Shimmering
beautiful
And
when
I
break,
it's
in
a
million
pieces
Hush,
when
no

You'll
find

on
my
tallest
tiptoes
Spinning
in

Shining

Hush,
I
know
they
said

end

But
I'm
still

my
tallest
tiptoes
Spinning
in
my
highest

Shining
just

I
want
you
to
know
I'm

I
can
change
everything
about
me
to
fit

And
they
called
off

down
When

and
the

clowns
I'm
still
on
that
tightrope
I'm
still
trying
everything
to
get
you
laughing
at
me
And
I'm
still
a
believer,
but
I
don't
know
why
I've
never
been

natural,
all
I
do
is
try,
try,

Gray
November
I've
been
down
since
July
Motion
capture
Put
me
in
a
bad
light
I
replay
my
footsteps
on
each
stepping
stone
Trying
to
find
the
one
where
I
went
wrong
Writing
letters
Addressed
to
the
fire
And
I
was
catchin'
my
breath
Starin'
out
an
open
window,
catchin'
my
death
And
I
couldn't
be
sure
I
had
a
feeling
so
peculiar
That
this
pain
would
be
for
Evermore
Hey,
December
Guess
I'm
feeling
unmoored
Can't
remember
What
I
used
to
fight
for
I
rewind
thе
tape,
but
all
it
does
is
pause
On
thе
very
moment
all
was
lost
Sending
signals
To
be
double-crossed
You
might
also
like
And
I
was
catchin'
my
breath
Barefoot
in
the
wildest
winter,
catchin'
my
death
And
I
couldn't
be
sure
I
had
a
feeling
so
peculiar
That
this
pain
would
be
for
Evermore
(Evermore)
Can't
not
think
of
all
the
cost
And
the
things
that
will
be
lost
Oh,
can
we
just
get
a
pause?
To
be
certain
we'll
be
tall
again
Whether
weather
be
the
frost
Or
the
violence
of
the
dog
days
I'm
on
waves,
out
being
tossed
Is
there
a
line
that
I
could
just
go
cross?
And
when
I
was
shipwrecked
(Can't
think
of
all
the
cost
now)
I
thought
of
you
(All
the
things
that
will
be
lost
now)
In
the
cracks
of
light
(Can
we
just
get
a
pause?)
I
dreamed
of
you
(To
be
certain
we'll
be
tall
again)
(If
you
think
of
all
the
cost)
It
was
real
enough
(Whether
weather
be
the
frost)
To
get
me
through
(Or
the
violence
of
the
dog
days)
(Or
the
violence
of
the
dog
days)
(Out
on
waves,
being
tossed)
(I'm
on
waves,
out
being
tossed)
But
I
swear
(Is
there
a
line
that
we
can
just
go
cross?)
You
were
there
And
I
was
catchin'
my
breath
Floors
of
a
cabin
creakin'
under
my
step
And
I
couldn't
be
sure
I
had
a
feeling
so
peculiar
This
pain
wouldn't
be
for
Evermore
Evermore

Lyrics
If
you
would've
blinked,
then
I
would've
Looked
away
at
the
first
glance
If
you
tasted
poison,
you
could've
Spit
me
out
at
the
first
chance
And
if
I
was
some
paint,
did
it
splatter
On
a
promising
grown
man?
And
if
I
was
a
child,
did
it
matter
If
you
got
to
wash
your
hands?
Ooh,
all
I
used
to
do
was
pray
Would've,
could've,
should've
If
you'd
never
looked
my
way
I
would've
stayed
on
my
knees
And
I
damn
sure
never
would've
danced
with
the
devil
At
nineteen
And
the
God's
honest
truth
is
that
the
pain
was
heaven
And
now
that
I'm
grown,
I'm
scared
of
ghosts
Memories
feel
like
weapons
And
now
that
I
know,
I
wish
you'd
left
me
wondering
If
you
never
touched
me,
I
would've
Gone
along
with
the
righteous
If
I
never
blushed,
then
they
could've
Never
whispered
about
this
And
if
you
never
saved
me
from
boredom
I
could've
gone
on
as
I
was
But,
Lord,
you
made
me
feel
important
And
then
you
tried
to
erase
us
You
might
also
like
Ooh,
you're
a
crisis
of
my

Would've,

If

Lyrics
Our
coming-of-age
has
come
and
gone
Suddenly
this
summer,
it's
clear
I
never
had
the
courage
of
my
convictions
As
long
as
danger
is
near
And
it's
just
around
the
corner,
darlin'
'Cause
it
lives
in
me
No,
I
could
never
give
you
peace
But
I'm
a
fire
and
I'll
keep
your
brittle
heart
warm
If
your
cascade,
ocean
wave
blues
come
All
these
people
think
love's
for
show
But
I
would
die
for
you
in
secret
The
devil's
in
the
details,
but
you
got
a
friend
in
me
Would
it
be
enough
if
I
could
never
give
you
peace?
Your
integrity
makes
me
seem
small
You
paint
dreamscapes
on
the
wall
I
talk
shit
with
my
friends,
it's
like
I'm
wasting
your
honor
And
you
know
that
I'd
swing
with
you
for
the
fences
Sit
with
you
in
the
trenches
Give
you
my
wild,
give
you
a
child
Give
you
the
silence
that
only
comes
when
two
people
understand
each
other
Family
that
I
chose,
now
that
I
see
your
brother
as
my
brother
Is
it
enough?
But
there's
robbers
to
the
east,
clowns
to
the
west
I'd
give
you
my
sunshine,
give
you
my
best
But
the
rain
is
always
gonna
come
if
you're
standin'
with
me
You
might
also
like
But
I'm
a
fire
and
I'll
keep
your
brittle
heart
warm
If
your
cascade,
ocean
wave
blues
come
All
these
people
think
love's
for
show
But
I
would
die
for
you
in
secret
The
devil's
in
the
details,
but
you
got
a
friend
in
me
Would
it
be
enough
if
I
could
never
give

Would

You
should
take
it
as
a
compliment
That
I
got
drunk
and
made
fun
of
the
way
you
talk
You
should
think
about
the
consequence
Of

I
got

Shit
Lyrics
Draw
the
cat
eye
sharp
enough
to
kill
a
man
You
did
some
bad
things,
but
I'm
the
worst
of
them
Sometimes
I
wonder
which
one'll
be
your
last
lie
They
say
looks
can
kill
and
I
might
try
I
don't
dress
for
women
I
don't
dress
for
men
Lately,
I've
been
dressin'
for
revenge
I
don't
start
shit,
but
I
can
tell
you
how
it
ends
Don't
get
sad,
get
even
So
on
the
weekends
I
don't
dress
for
friends
Lately,
I've
been
dressin'
for
revenge
She
needed
cold,
hard
proof,
so
I
gave
her
some
She
had
the
envelope,
where
you
think
she
got
it
from?
Now
she
gets
the
house,
gets
the
kids,
gets
the
pride
Picture
me
thick
as
thieves
with
your
ex-wife
And
she
looks
so
pretty
Drivin'
in
your
Benz
Lately,
she's
been
dressin'
for
revenge
She
don't
start
shit,
but
she
can
tell
you
how
it
ends
Don't
get
sad,
get
even
So
on
the
weekends
She
don't
dress
for

Lately,
she's

Rain
Lyrics
Rain
He
wanted
it
comfortable,
I
wanted
that
pain
He
wanted
a
bride,
I
was
making
my
own
name
Chasing
that
fame,
he
stayed
the
same
All
of
me
changed
like
midnight
My
town
was
a
wasteland
Full
of
cages,
full
of
fences
Pageant
queens
and
big
pretenders
But
for
some,
it
was
paradise
My
boy
was
a
montage
A
slow-motion,
love
potion
Jumping
off
things
in
the
ocean
I
broke
his
heart
'cause
he
was
nice
He
was
sunshine,
I
was
midnight
rain
He
wanted
it
comfortable,
I
wanted
that
pain
He
wanted
a
bride,
I
was
making
my
own
name
Chasing
that
fame,
he
stayed
the
same
All
of
me
changed
like
midnight
It
came
like
a
postcard
Picture
perfect
shiny
family
Holiday
peppermint
candy
But
for
him,
it's
every
day
So
I
peered
through
a
window
A
deep
portal,
time
travel
All
the
love
we
unravel
And
the
life
I
gave
away
'Cause
he
was
sunshine,
I
was
midnight
rain
You
might
also
like
He
wanted
it
comfortable,
I
wanted

He
wanted

All

All

I
guess
sometimes
we
all
get
Just
what
we
wanted,
just
what
we
wanted
And
he
never
thinks
of
me
Except
for
when
I'm
on
TV
I
guess
sometimes
we
all
get
Some
kind
of
haunted,
some
kind
of
haunted
And
I
never
think
of
him
Except
on
midnights
like
this

Car
Lyrics
No,
nothing
good
starts
in
a
getaway
car
It
was
the
best
of
times,
the
worst
of
crimes
I
struck
a
match
and
blew
your
mind
But
I
didn't
mean
it
and
you
didn’t
see
it
The
ties
were
black,
the
lies
were
white
In
shades
of
gray
in
candlelight
I
wanted
to
leave
him,
I
needed
a
reason
"X"
marks
the
spot
where
we
fell
apart
He
poisoned
the
well,
I
was
lyin'
to
myself
I
knew
it
from
the
first
Old
Fashioned,
we
were
cursed
We
never
had
a
shotgun
shot
in
the
dark
(Oh!)
You
were
drivin'
the
getaway
car
We
were
flyin’,
but
we'd
never
get
far
Don't
pretend
it's
such
a
mystery
Think
about
the
place
where
you
first
met
me
Ridin'
in
a

There
were
sirens
in
the

of

No,

No,

You

It
was

the
prison
break
The
light
of

But
you

and
I
was
just
drinkin’
While
he
was
runnin'
after
us,
I
was
screamin’,
"Go,
go,
go!"
But
with
three
of
us,
honey,
it's
a
sideshow
And
a
circus
ain't
a

now
we're

Lyrics
What
did
you
think
I'd
say
to
that?
Does
a
scorpion
sting
when
fighting
back?
They
strike
to
kill,
and
you
know
I
will
You
know
I
will
What
do
you
sing
on
your
drive
home?
Do
you
see
my
face
in
the
neighbor's
lawn?
Does
she
smile?
Or
does
she
mouth,
"Fuck
you
forever"?
Every
time
you
call
me
crazy,
I
get
more
crazy
What
about
that?
And
when
you
say
I
seem
angry,
I
get
more
angry
And
there's
nothing
like
a
mad
woman
What
a
shame
she
went
mad
No
one
likes
a
mad
woman
You
made
her
like
that
And
you'll
poke
that
bear
'til
her
claws
come
out
And
you
find
something
to
wrap
your
noose
around
And
there's
nothing
like
a
mad
woman
Now
I
breathe
flames
each
time
I
talk
My
cannons
all
firin'
at
your
yacht
They
say
"move
on,"
but
you
know
I
won't
And
women
like
hunting
witches
too
Doing
your
dirtiest
work
for
you
It's
obvious
that
wanting
me
dead
Has
really
brought
you
two
together
You
might
also
like
Every
time
you
call
me
crazy,
I
get

crazy
What
about
that?
And
when
you
say
I
seem
angry,
I
get
more
angry
And
there's
nothing
like
a

What
a

I'm
taking
my

taking
my
time
'Cause
you
took
everything
from
me
Watching
you
climb,
watching
you
climb
Over
people
like
me
The
master
of
spin
has
a
couple
side

Good
wives
always
know
She
should
be
mad,
should
be
scathing

would

I

They'd
say
I

before
I
found
someone

commit
to
And
that
would
be
okay

do
Every

I
had
made
would
make
me
more
of

to

I’d
be

I'd
be

When
everyone
believes
ya,
what's
that

I’m
so
sick

Wonderin'

I'd

I'd

(Man)
I’d

I

They

their

and
question
how

I
deserve
What
I
was

if
I
was
rude
Could
all
be
separated
from
my
good
ideas
and
power
moves
And
they
would
toast
to
me,
oh
(Ayy),
let

I’d

You

No

You
know
I
left
a
part
of
me
back
in
New
York
You
knew
the
hero
died
so
what's
the
movie
for?
You
knew
it
still
hurts
underneath
my
scars
From
when
they
pulled
me
apart
You
knew
the
password
so
I
let
you
in
the
door
You
knew
you
won
so
what's
the
point
of
keeping
score?
You
knew
it
still
hurts
underneath
my
scars
From
when
they
pulled
me
apart
But
what
you
did
was
just
as
dark
(Ah,
ah,
ah)
Darling,
this
was
just
as
hard
As
when
they
pulled
me
apart
My
only
one
My
kingdom
come
undone
My
broken
drum
You
have
beaten
my
heart
Don't
want
no
other
shade
of
blue
but
you
No
other
sadness
in
the
world
would
