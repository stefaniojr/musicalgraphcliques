Lyrics
(Ah-ah,
ah-ah,
ah-ah,
ah-ah)
I
was
listenin'
to
the
ocean
I
saw
a
face
in
the
sand
But
when
I
picked
it
up
Then
it
vanished
away
from
my
hands,
dah
I
had
a
dream
I
was
seven
Climbin'
my
way
in
a
tree
I
saw
a
piece
of
heaven
Waitin'
in
patience
for
me,
dah
And
I
was
runnin'
far
away
Would
I
run
off
the
world
someday?
Nobody
knows,
nobody
knows
And
I
was
dancing
in
the
rain
I
felt
alive
and
I
can't
complain
But
no,
take
me
home
Take
me
home
where
I
belong
I
can't
take
it
anymore
I
was
painting
a
picture
The
picture
was
a
painting
of
you
And
for
a
moment
I
thought
you
were
here
But
then
again,
it
wasn't
true,
dah
And
all
this
time
I
have
been
lyin'
Oh,
lyin'
in
secret
to
myself
I've
been
putting
sorrow
on
the
farthest
place
on
my
shelf
La-di-da
You
might
also
like
And
I
was
runnin'
far
away
Would
I
run
off
the
world
someday?
Nobody
knows,
nobody
knows
And
I
was
dancing
in
the
rain
I
felt
alive
and
I
can't
complain
But
no,
take
me
home
Take
me
home
where
I
belong
I
got
no
other
place
to

No,
take

Take

No,
take

Take
me
home
where
I
belong
I
can't
take

anymore
But
I
kept
runnin'
for
a
soft
place
to
fall
And

As

As

But

So

Words
falling

All
that

Is

Earth
colored
red?
As
I
land
like

flower
on

Love

wild
You
fell
apart
Like
a

can
be
broken
into
sand
A
thousand

Spread
across
a

And

I

And

turn

For
Love
Lyrics
They
say
there
is
a
war
Between
the
man
and
the
woman
(Ah-ah-ah,
ah-ah-ah)
I've
never
felt
like
this
before
My
heart
knew
that
I
couldn't
(Ah-ah-ah)
And
then
you
take
me
in
And
everything
in
me
begins
to
feel
like
I
belong
Like
everybody
needs
a
home
And
when
I
take
your
hand
Like
the
world
has
never
held
a
man
I
know
I
cannot
heal
the
hurt
But
I
will
hold
you
here
forever
If
I
can,
if
I
can
And
then
I
learned
the
truth
How
everything
good
in
life
seems
to
lead
back
to
you
And
every
single
time
I
run
into
your
arms
I
feel
like
I
exist
for
love
Like
I
exist
for
love
Only
for
love
I
can't
imagine
how
it
is
to
be
forbidden
from
loving
(Ah-ah-ah,
ah-ah-ah)
'Cause
when
you
walked
into
my
life
I
could
feel
my
life
begin
Like
I
was
torn
apart
the
minute
I
was
only
born
You
might
also
like
And
you're
the
other
half
The
only
thing
that
makes
me
whole
I
know
it
sounds
like
a
lot
But
you
really
need
to
know
We
are
leaning
out
for
love
And
we
will
lean
for
love
forever,
I
know
I
love
you
so
And
then
I
learned
the
truth
How
everything
good
in
life
seems
to
lead
back
to
you
And
every
single
time
I
run
into
your
arms
I
feel
like
I
exist
for
love
Only
for
love
And
when
you
say
my
name
Like
white
horses
on
the
waves
I
think
it
feels
the
same
As
an
ocean
in
my
veins
And
you'll
be
diving
in
Like
nothing
is
out
of
place
And
we
exist
for
love
Only
for
love
And
I
love
you,
I
love
you,
I
love
you
And
I
love
you,
I
love
you,
I
love
you24Embed

For

Lyrics
I
run
from

fuel

I
know
I
created

I
know
I
can't
fight
the
sad
days
and
bad
nights
But
I
never
asked
for
your
help
You
got
hurt
No,

So
you
took
the
love
from

Into

with

got
nеrves
But
they

So

This

Begging

the
Eyes
of
a
Child
Lyrics
World
is
covered
by
our
trails
Scars
we
cover
up
with
paint
Watch
them
preaching
sour
lies
I
would
rather
see
this
world
through
the
eyes
of
a
child
Through
the
eyes
of
a
child
Darker
times
will
come
and
go
Times
you
need
to
see
her
smile
And
mothers'
hands
are
warm
and
mild
I
would
rather
feel
this
world
through
the
skin
of
a
child
Through
the
skin
of
a
child
When
a
human
strokes
your
skin
That
is
when
you
let
them
in
Let
them
in
before
they
go
I
would
rather
feel
alive
with
a
childlike
soul
With
a
childlike
soul
Hey

oh,

Oh

Ah-ah

Oh
hey

don't

Lost
in
the
moment
again
Stuck
where
the
road
has
no
end
Keeping
the
thought
in
our
minds
One
day
life
will
be
kind
We
are
not
alive
We
are
surviving
every
time
We
are
not
alive
Only
dreams
inside
our
minds
We
are
home
We
are
home
Home
We
are
home
We
are
home
Home
Endless
days
of
complaints
Forcing
the
light
to
our
veins
Keeping
the
hope
in
our
minds
One
day
life
will
be
kind

Calm

I

I'm

again
I
am
warm
inside,
for
a

while
I
am
fine...
We

Wrapped

Lyrics
He
told
me
I
belong
in
a
churchyard
He
told
me
I
could
walk
away
but
I
wouldn't
get
far
Tell
me,
how
do
people
know
what
is
hurt,
what
is
love?
He
told
me
I
belong
in
a
churchyard
Words
pointy
like
arrows,
wounds
no
one
can
see
He
closed
all
the
windows
as
his
anger
broke
free
I
will
not
remember
you
as
somebody
nice
Please,
will
you
remember
me
and
cry?

He
told

but

Tell
me,
how
do
people
know
what
is
hurt,
what

He
told
me
I
belong
in
a
churchyard
Hate
followed
him
gently,
black
seeds
in
his
heart
Roots
tearing
the
love
in
him
apart
