Payback
is
a
bad
bitch
And
baby,
I'm
the
baddest
(I'm

baddest,
I'm

baddest...)
Go
Now,
I'm
out
here
lookin'
like
revenge
Feelin'
like
a
ten,
the
best
I've
ever
been
And,
yeah,
I
know
how
bad
it
must
hurt
to
see
me
like
this
But
it
gets
worse
(Wait
a
minute)
Now,
you're
out
here
lookin'
like
regret
Ain't
too
proud
to
beg,
second
chance,
you'll
never
get
And,
yeah,
I
know
how
bad
it
must
hurt
to
see
me
like
this
But
it
gets
worse
(Wait
a
minute)
Now,
payback
is
a
bad
bitch
And
baby,
I'm
the
baddest
You
fuckin'
with
a
savage
Can't
have
this,

this
(Ah)
And
it'd
be

Yeah,

Baby,
fineness

Tell

bet
it's
such
a
bitter
pill
And,
yeah,
I
know,
you
thought
you
had
bigger,
better
things
Bet,
right
now,
this
stings
(Wait

'Cause
the

is
greener

Bright

And
I'm

Won't

But

It's
just

pain's
more

Lyrics
Mmm,
ooh,
yeah
Mustard
on
the
beat,
ho
He
felt
just
like
you
His
arms,
his
lips
His
promises
were
just
as
smooth
His
grip,
it
fit,
though
I
admit
that
Only
you
could
make
me
feel
the
way
you
do
Though,
you
know
love
is
blind
And
he
just
caught
my
eye
You
know
me
and
honestly
I'm
better
without
ya
Don't
you
got
me
checking
on
my
phone
by
the
hour
Baby,
I'm
hoping
and
praying
My
knees
weak,
I'm
shaking
'Cause
you
know
that
I
always
needed
saving
Now
I'm
fucking
lonely
'cause
you
didn't
want
me
Trying
to
show
me,
that
you
didn't
own
me
But
all
you
do
is
leave
me
fucking
lonely
Knees
on
the
concrete,
cut
up
and
bleeding
For
no
goddamn
reason
But
all
you
do
is
leave
me
fucking
lonely
Leave
me
fucking
lonely
Leave
me
fucking
lonely
Leave
me
fucking
lonely
You
might
also
like
The
month
was
June
The
smoky
sun,
our
fated
one
It
ended
too
soon
With
tears
as
proof,
'cause
all
the
carpets
stained
with
juice
Blood
on
my
shoes
and
you
know
love
is
blind
I
can
see
it
in
your
eyes
You
know
me
and
honestly
I'm
better
without
ya
Don't
you
got
me
checking
on
my
phone
by
the

Baby,
I'm

Leave

Bitch,
can't
even
say
I
miss
you
back
over
the
fuckin'
text
Every
time
you
slept
over
my
pad,
you
over
fuckin'
slept
Toni
Braxton
told
me
breathe
again,
don't
hold
no
fuckin'
breath
Gave
your
ass
directions
to
my
heart
and
your
ass
busted
left
Climbin'
up
the
money
tree,
the
tree
without
the
lover's
nest
'Cause
lovebirds
are
some
busy
bees
You
fuck
around,
get
stung
again
And
you
didn't
leave
your
underwear
'Cause
she
didn't
arrive
in
no
underwear
Look,
baby,
either
love
is
blind
or
nothing's
there,
because
I
can't
see
the
forest
from
the
tree,
the
water
from
the
sea
And
I
was
starting
to
believe,
but
it's
a
forest
full
of
dreams
I
smoke
bars
full
of
weed
and
call
it
what
I
see
And
when
you
leave,
I
hope
you
know
you
bring
This
forest
to
his
leaves
I'm
fucking
lonely,
yeah
Lonely
Leave
me
fucking
lonely
Leave
me
fucking
lonely
Leave
me

With
the
Devil
Lyrics
Oh-woah
It's
just
a
little
red
wine,
I'll
be
fine
Not
like
I
wanna
do
this
every
night
I've
been
good,
don't
I
deserve
it?
I
think
I
earned
it,
feels
like
it's
worth
it
In
my
mind,
mind
Twisted
reality,
hopeless
insanity
I
told
you
I
was
okay,
but
I
was
lying
I
was
dancing
with
the
devil,
out
of
control
Almost
made
it
to
Heaven
It
was
closer
than
you
know
Playing
with
the
enemy,
gambling
with
my
soul
It's
so
hard
to
say
no
When
you're
dancing
with
the
devil
Mm-mm-mm,
yeah,
yeah
It's
just
a
little
white
line,
I'll
be
fine
But
soon,
that
little
white
line
is
a
little
glass
pipe
Tinfoil
remedy,
almost
got
the
best
of
me
I
keep
praying
I
don't
reach
the
end
of
my
lifetime,
mm
You
might

knew
my
limit,
yeah
I
thought
that
I
could
quit
it,

I
thought
that
I
could
walk
away
easily
But
here
I
am,
falling
down
on
my
knees
Praying
for
better
days
to
come
and
wash
this
pain
away
Could
you
please
forgive
me?
Lord,
I'm
sorry
for
dancing

Oh,

Dreamland,
take
me
there

I
want
your
sex
If

I
wouldn't
turn

Touch,

you
If

my

you
deep
If

I'd

off
my
chest
Show
you
all
the
red
lace
underneath
this
dress
And

eyes

crossing
paths

the

Lyrics
Skies
are
crying,
I
am
watching
catching
tear
drops
in
my
hands
Only
silence
as
it's
ending
like
we
never
had
a
chance
Do
you
have
to
make
me
feel
like
there's
nothing
left
of
me?
You
can
take
everything
I
have
You
can
break
everything
I
am
Like
I'm
made
of
glass
Like
I'm
made
of
paper
Go
on
and
try
to
tear
me
down
I
will
be
rising
from
the
ground
Like
a
skyscraper
Like
a
skyscraper
As
the
smoke
clears,
I
awaken
and
untangle
you
from
me
Would
it
make
you
feel
better
to
watch
me
while
I
bleed?
All
my
windows
still
are
broken,
but
I'm
standing
on
my
feet
You
can
take
everything
I
have
You
can
break
everything
I
am
Like
I'm
made
of
glass
Like
I'm
made
of
paper
Go
on
and
try
to

I

I'm

Watch
you
disappear
Yeah,
oh
Go
run,
run,
run
Yeah,
it's
a
long
way
down
But
I
am
closer
to
the
clouds
up
here
You
can
take
everything
I
have
You
can
break
everything
I
am
Like
I'm
made

I'm

Lyrics
This
is
a
story
that
I
have
never
told
I
gotta
get
this
off
my
chest
to
let
it
go
I
need
to
take
back
the
light
inside
you
stole
You're
a
criminal,
and
you
steal
like
you're
a
pro
All
the
pain
and
the
truth
I
wear
like
a
battle
wound
So
ashamed,
so
confused
I
was
broken
and
bruised
Now
I'm
a
warrior,
now
I've
got
thicker
skin
I'm
a
warrior,
I'm
stronger
than
I've
ever
been
And
my
armor
is
made
of
steel,
you
can't
get
in
I'm
a
warrior,
and
you
can
never
hurt
me
again
Out
of
the
ashes,
I'm
burning
like
a
fire
You
can
save
your
apologies,
you're
nothing
but
a
liar
I've
got
shame,
I've
got
scars
that
I
will
never
show
I'm
a
survivor,
in
more
ways
than
you
know
'Cause
all
the
pain
and
the
truth
I
wear
like
a
battle
wound
So
ashamed,
so
confused
I'm
not
broken
or
bruised
You
might
also
like
'Cause
now
I'm
a
warrior,
now
I've
got
thicker
skin
I'm
a

I'm
stronger

I've
ever
been
And
my
armor
is
made
of
steel,
you
can't
get
in
I'm
a
warrior,
and
you
can
never
hurt
me
There's
a
part
of
me
I
can't
get
back
A
little
girl
grew
up
too
fast
All
it
took
was
once,
I'll
never
be
the
same
Now
I'm
taking
back
my
life
today
Nothing
left
that
you
can
say
'Cause
you
were
never
gonna
take
the
blame
anyway
Now
I'm
a
warrior,
I've
got
thicker
skin
I'm
a
warrior,
I'm
stronger
than
I've
ever
been
And
my
armor
is

you
can't

I'm

you
can

No,

Ooh,
yeah,

You
can
never
hurt
me...
