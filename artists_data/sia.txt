Lyrics
I
know
you,
you’re
a
special
one
Some
see
crazy
where
I
see
love
You
fall
so
low
but
shoot
so
high
Big
dreamers
shoot
for
open
sky
So
much
life
in
those
open
eyes
So
much
depth,
you
look
for
the
light
But
when
your
wounds
open,
you
will
cry
You’ll
cry
out
now
and
you’ll
question
why
I
can
see
a
rainbow
In
your
tears
as
they
fall
on
down
I
can
see
your
soul
grow
Through
the
pain
as
they
hit
the
ground
I
can
see
a
rainbow
In
your
tears
as
the
sun
comes
out
As
the
sun
comes
out
I
am
here
and
I
see
your
pain
Through
the
storms,
through
the
clouds,
the
rain
I’m
telling
you
you
cannot
escape
You
can
do
it,
just
feel
baby
You
might
also
like
I
can
see
a
rainbow
In
your
tears
as
they
fall
on
down
I
can
see
your
soul
grow
Through
the
pain
as
they
hit
the
ground
I
can
see
a
rainbow
In
your
tears
as
the
sun
comes
out
As
the
sun
comes
out
Here
comes
the
sun
Smiling
down
Here
comes
the
sun
Smiling
down
Here
comes
the
sun
Smiling
down
Smiling
down
I
can
see
a
rainbow
In

as

I

grow
Through

A
toast
to
the
groom!
(To
the
groom,
to
the
groom,
to
the
groom)
To
the
bride!
(To
the
bride,
to
the
bride,
to
the
bride)
From
your
sister
(Angelica,
Angelica,
Angelica)
Who
is
always
by
your
side
(By
your
side,
by
your
side)
To
your
union
and
the
hope
that
you
provide
(You
provide,
you
provide)
May
you
always
(always)
Be
satisfied
(Rewind)
Rewind!
Rewind!
I
remember
that
night,
I
just
might
I
remember
that
night,
I
just
might
I
remember
that
night,
I
remember
that—
I
remember
that
night,
I
just
might
Regret
that
night
for
the
rest
of
my
days
I
remember
those
soldier
boys
Tripping
over
themselves
to
win
our
praise
I
remember
that
dreamlike
candlelight
Like
a
dream
that
you
can’t
quite
place
But
Alexander,
I’ll
never
forget
the
first
Time
I
saw
your
face
I
have
never
been
the
same
Intelligent
eyes
in
a
hunger-pang
frame
And
when
you
said
“Hi,”
I
forgot
my
dang
name
Set
my
heart
aflame,
ev’ry
part
aflame
This
is
not
a
game…
You
might
also
like
You
strike
me
as
a
woman
who
has
never
been
satisfied
I’m
sure
I
don’t
know
what
you
mean,
you
forget
yourself
You’re
like
me,
I’ve
never
been
satisfied
Is
that
right?
I
have
never
been
satisfied
My
name's
Angelica
Schuyler
Alexander
Hamilton
Where’s
your
fam’ly
from?
Unimportant,
there’s
a
million
things
I
haven’t
done
Just
you
wait,
just
you
wait...
So
so
so—
So
this
is
what
it
feels
like
to
match
wits
With
someone
at
your
level!
What
the
hell
is
the
catch?
It’s
The
feeling
of
freedom,
of
seein’
the
light
It’s
Ben
Franklin
with
a
key
and
a
kite!
You
see
it,
right?
The
conversation
lasted
two
minutes,
maybe
three
minutes
Ev’rything
we
said
in
total
agreement,
it’s
A
dream
and
it’s
a
bit
of
a
dance
A
bit
of
a
posture,
it’s
a
bit
of
a
stance
He’s
a
bit
of
a
flirt,
but
I’m
‘a
give
him
a
chance
I
asked
about
his
fam’ly,
did
you
see
his
answer?
His
hands
started
fidgeting,
he
looked
askance
He’s
penniless,
he’s
flying
by
the
seat
of
his
pants
Handsome,
boy,
does
he
know
it!
Peach
fuzz,
and
he
can’t
even
grow
it!
I
wanna
take
him
far
away
from
this
place
Then
I
turn
and
see
my
sister’s
face
and
she
is
Helpless
And
I
know
she
is
Helpless
And
her
eyes
are
just
Helpless
And
I
realize
three
fundamental
truths
at
the
exact
same
time
I’m
a
girl
in
a
world
in
which
My
only
job
is
to
marry
rich
My
father
has
no
sons
so
I’m
the
one
Who
has
to
social
climb
for
one
Cause
I’m
the
oldest
and
the
wittiest
and
the
gossip
in
New
York
City
is
insidious
And
Alexander
is
penniless
Ha!
That
doesn’t
mean
I
want
him
any
less
(Doesn’t
mean
I
want
him
any
less)
(Doesn’t
mean
I
want
him
any
less)
(Doesn’t
mean
I
want
him
any
less)
He’s
after
me
'cause
I’m
a
Schuyler
sister
And
that
elevates
his
status,
I’d
Have
to
be
naïve
to
set
that
aside
Maybe
that
is
why
I
introduce
him
to
Eliza
Now
that’s
his
bride
Nice
going,
Angelica,
he
was
right
You
will
never
be
satisfied
(I
will
never
be
satisfied)
(I
will
never
be
satisfied)
I
know
my
sister
like
I
know
my
own
mind
You
will
never
find
anyone
as
trusting
or
as
kind
If
I
tell
her
that
I
love
him
she’d
be
silently
resigned
He’d
be
mine
She
would
say,
“I’m
fine”
But
she’d
be
lying
But
when
I
fantasize
at
night
It’s
Alexander’s
eyes
As
I
romanticize
what
might
have
been
If
I
hadn’t
sized
him
up
so
quickly
At
least
my
dear
Eliza’s
his
wife
At
least
I
keep
his
eyes
in
my
life…
To
the
groom!
(To
the
groom,
to
the
groom,
to
the
groom)
To
the
bride!
(To
the
bride,
to
the
bride,
to
the
bride)
From
your
sister
(Angelica,
Angelica,
Angelica)
Who
is
always
by
your
side
(By
your
side,
by
your
side)
To
your
union
and
the
hope
that
you
provide
(You
provide,
you
provide)
May
you
always
Be
satisfied
And
I
know
(yeah)
She’ll
be
happy
as
his
bride
And
I
know
He
will
never
be
satisfied
I
will
never
be

Good
on
a
Wednesday)
Lyrics
Feelin'
good
on
a
Wednesday,
uh
The
image
of
me
that
you
see
Is
distorted,
twisted,
broken,
fractured
Isolated
—
miles
out
to
sea
I
don't
want
a
separate
place,
I
need
to
feel
safe
Not
thrown
away,
away,
away
And
I
will
push
(Push!)
To
tear
down
the
walls
(Push!
Push!)
Of
this
box
you
put
me
in
(Push!
Push!)
'Cause
you
don't
understand
(Push,
ow,
hot!
Push,
ow,
ow,
hot!)
And
now
you
push
To
find
a
label
that
fits
me
I'm
feelin'
good
on
a
Wednesday
With
my
sparklin'
thoughts
Help
me
unload
the
car
Ya!
Ya!
Ya!
And
so
I
push
To
close
the
door
Of
the
stall
you've
made
for
me
To
keep
me
away!
And
now
we
push
(Push!)
To
stand
together
Because
I
am
Lorde!
Ya!
Ya!
Ya!
Ya!
Ya!
Ya!
I
am
Lorde!
I
am
Lorde!
Ya!
Ya!

I

Rough

will

calm
Hold
on
while

the

down

But

not

There

when

There's
only

the

So

it's

So
